2322823,Info Integration & Informatics,Archana Venkataraman,CAREER : Small Data in a Big World : Balancing Interpretability and Generalizability for Data Integration in Clinical Neuroscience,1/1/23,"Neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders affect millions of people worldwide and carry a staggering societal cost . Despite ongoing efforts , clinicians have a bare-bones understanding of these disorders , and hence , a limited ability to treat them . From an analytics perspective , clinical neuroscience is a field of high-dimensional datasets , small sample sizes , massive patient variability , and most importantly , an arguable lack of ground truth information . These challenges have led to a trade-off between the interpretability of a given model and its generalizability to new data . At one extreme , classical statistics allows us to formulate and test interpretable hypotheses about the brain , but it can not make patient-specific generalizations . At the other extreme , conventional machine learning algorithms are geared towards patient generalizability but rarely illuminate a brain-basis for the prediction . This CAREER program will develop a Coupled Network Optimization ( CNO ) framework that balances the two analytical extremes . The resulting algorithms will reveal interpretable system-level interactions in the brain that can predict the behavioral and cognitive deficits of a given disorder . In parallel , the investigators have formulated a diverse range of educational initiatives to train the next generation of interdisciplinary data scientists. < br/ > < br/ > Mathematically , the CNO framework estimates a low-dimensional network manifold for functional neuroimaging data . The elemental bases of this manifold will correspond to interpretable group-level features , whereas the patient-specific projections will capture predictive information . The technical exploration of this award will unfold in three modular stages , each of which tackles an open challenge in the field . Thrust I will improve the CNO interpretability by imposing a patient-specific graph topology to guide the salient functional interactions . Thrust II will advance the CNO generalizability by introducing nonlinear and nonparametric regression models . Finally , Thrust III will leverage an equivalent Bayesian representation to tackle the challenges of multisite analysis . The CNO framework will be applied to two markedly different application testbeds : a large multi-site repository of neuroimaging , behavioral and genetic data for autism , and a focused clinical trial of functional electrical stimulation for spinal cord injury rehabilitation . Beyond the scientific goals , this award includes a three-pronged educational plan to build strong technical foundations , foster interdisciplinary collaborations through engagement and communication , and finally , motivate young women into the STEM fields . The investigators have outlined a comprehensive schedule of activities , ranging from curriculum development at the high school , undergraduate and graduate levels , to organizing student networking events , to mentoring high school women through the Johns Hopkins Women in Science and Engineering outreach. < br/ > < br/ > This award reflects NSF 's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation 's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria ."
2328619,Robust Intelligence,Florian Willomitzer,CRII : RI : Sub-mm 3D Scanning of Real-World Scenes with Active Multi-View Event Sensing,10/1/22,"This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 ( Public Law 117-2 ) . < br/ > < br/ > State-of-the-art 3D imaging methods are not able to measure all possible classes of objects at once and still need to be tailored to a specific application . This is one of the main reasons why 3D imaging is still not omnipresent in our society , and still solely trained experts with task-specific equipment are able to capture high-quality 3D models . This project seeks to build a ? one fits all ? system that has the potential to change this . The targeted system enables precise 3D measurements of complicated surfaces/scenes in today ? s billion-dollar industries , such as virtual reality , industrial inspection , autonomous navigation , or medical imaging . Many of these industries routinely run into particularly challenging scenarios for 3D scanning systems . Moreover , a scene-independent and precise 3D sensing system can have many applications . The produced sets of high-quality 3D data can usher the next wave in vision-related artificial intelligence research , leading to algorithms with unprecedented detection quality , prediction accuracy , or navigation precision . Given the current dissimilation of related techniques in all sectors of our modern society , everyone can profit . The project is accompanied by a comprehensive education program incorporating 3D imaging principles in a curriculum for Chicago afterschool programs to introduce at-risk youth to basic concepts in optics , image processing , and electronics. < br/ > < br/ > The focus of this research is to solve a long-standing problem in Computer Vision : high-resolution active 3D scanning of scenes cluttered with objects of mixed specularity and polluted by undesirable light contributions such as ambient illumination or strong inter-reflections . Existing approaches for this challenging task deliver rather sobering results or rely on large training datasets or other extensive prior knowledge , such as the geometry and reflectance of objects in the scene . An easy and flexible solution that delivers high-quality data is of significant interest for researchers in the broader computer vision community . This research distills the past decade ? s research of the investigator and his colleagues . It combines previous experience in active multi-view 3D imaging concepts for different object classes with the novel detection modality of biologically inspired event sensors ( which operate on a fundamentally different principle than conventional sensors ) . By properly facilitating the existing tradeoffs in 3D imaging and event sensing , the team will develop theory , hardware , and algorithms that lead to a fundamentally new type of 3D camera . The developed technique significantly advances the state-of-the-art and our fundamental understanding of limits. < br/ > < br/ > This award reflects NSF 's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation 's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria ."
2303007,IUSE,Steven Cutchin,Using Extended Reality to Close Equity Gaps in Laboratory Training,8/1/23,"Many undergraduates enter college level chemistry classes without prior experience in a chemistry lab , often due to unequal access to laboratory facilities in high school . Since lab experience is an integral component of most traditional chemistry courses , students arriving without this background can be at a disadvantage , creating feelings of anxiety that could lead to a lack of persistence in STEM pathways . This Research on Emerging Technologies for Teaching and Learning ( RETTL ) project will develop immersive XR ( Extended Reality ) and web-based ( non-immersive ) learning experiences for first-year college students taking chemistry lab courses . The technology proposed in this project will provide an effective introduction to the undergraduate chemistry lab that will reinforce their knowledge of chemistry terminology while minimizing anxiety associated with performing experiments for the first time in an unfamiliar and timed setting . Newly designed modules will orient incoming students to the chemistry laboratory and introduce them to experiments that augment the lecture portion of their courses . The purpose of these modules is to supplement and reinforce lab training through an active learning , multi-sensory learning interface . While many studies have focused on Virtual Reality ( VR ) experiences in education , this project specifically examines the emotional and cognitive impacts of Extended Reality interventions on students and aims to improve upon the technology , based on student feedback throughout the project . In addition , as the Covid-19 pandemic highlighted , there is a need to develop virtual educational tools that provide comparable experiences for all students . < br/ > < br/ > This project examines an innovative introduction to the chemistry lab experience by applying the use of virtual reality technology to chemistry education . The study will examine the extent to which VR and XR training modules can prepare students for entry to a chemistry lab course , reinforce conventional lab training , boost knowledge of chemistry literacy , and minimize anxiety associated with performing experiments . The project goal is to deliver transformative experiences through XR technology that will positively impact the ability of undergraduates in first-year chemistry courses to engage with and persist in scientific settings . The project will employ an inclusive design-centered approach to the development of the XR modules , where extensive suggestions from students and other stakeholders will refine and improve the technology. < br/ > < br/ > This award reflects NSF 's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation 's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria ."
2239897,HCC-Human-Centered Computing,Suining He,CAREER : Structural and Accountable Behavior Understandings and Human-centered AI Designs with Naturalistic Micromobility Riding Data,5/1/23,"Micromobility systems are small , lightweight vehicles that usually operate below 15 mph . Examples include regular and electric bicycles , stand-up electric scooters , and 3-wheeled scooters equipped with seats . Understanding how micromobility riders should behave to minimize conflicts with other constituents of urban traffic is essential . Using this understanding in the design of micromobility platforms and their interactions with the rider will improve safety and comfort in urban transportation and enhance public acceptance . Rider behavior is structured , consisting of maneuvers such as acceleration , turns , and dismounts and macroscopic behaviors such as the selection of locations to visit and paths to take . Building structured models of rider behavior is necessary as the existing models are difficult to use for interpreting rider accountability , and whether behaviors are acceptable to the public . To address these challenges , this project proposes to design a novel Structural and Accountable micromobility Rider Behavior Understanding System ( SARBUS ) . SARBUS will provide the micromobility rider behavior modeling through human-centered artificial intelligence . For concrete insights and prototype development , the project will focus on the increasingly popular stand-up electric scooters ( e-scooters ) . The model development will use data from continuous multi-modal sensors collected during real-world riding scenarios . The principal investigator will recruit and train students from under-represented groups in research , and will use the project research to promote teaching and training through student mentoring , new course development , and outreach activities. < br/ > < br/ > This project will be composed of two interleaved modeling thrusts . Thrust A will develop a reinforcement learning technique that interactively learns and captures the rider 's macroscopic location visit and paths ( through GPS logs ) and microscopic maneuvering behaviors ( through accelerometers and gyroscopes ) , as well as their structural inter-dependencies . This thrust will derive a graph representation that will be used by SARBUS to illuminate and explain the riders ' decision-making process . Thrust B will build models from the motion sensor readings of the maneuver behaviors ( accelerometers and gyroscopes ) , recorded ( on-board ) riding videos and the human textual annotations of those videos . These data will capture the interactions of the riders with other road users and the environment . This thrust will quantify the relationships across these modalities through graph learning , and the resulting models will reveal when rider behaviors create conflicts with other traffic elements , and identify rider accountability . The principal investigator will further conduct e-scooter rider case studies with SARBUS to understand how the structural rider behavior modeling and accountability interpretation can together benefit the riders in route selection and riding behavior with enhanced travel efficiency and fewer conflicts. < br/ > < br/ > This award reflects NSF 's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation 's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria ."
2301356,HCC-Human-Centered Computing,Skylar Tibbits,Collaborative Research : HCC : Small : Computational Design and Application of Wearable Haptic Knits,5/15/23,"Social touch is a natural mode of communication between people and better understanding of how to convey social touch mechanistically will result in new forms of communication and increased capabilities of wearable devices that improve human health and quality of life . The importance of social touch is becoming more evident as we increase remote communication through email , text messages and videoconferencing . Prior work has shown that social touch can be replicated through wearable and holdable devices , but current devices are bulky and impractical . This research will combine principles of soft robotics and knit textiles of varying stiffness to design and fabricate a new kind of soft wearable haptic device , in which careful specification of stitch size , placement , and material in a knit sleeve will control the deformation of pneumatic bladders that apply force to the wearer . Project outcomes will advance knowledge in the field of social touch and human perception , and will lay the foundation for a variety of other types of knit-textile-based devices , including soft assistive devices . Additional broad impact will derive from activities designed to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in engineering through lab tours , outreach programs , and mentoring of students from groups that are underrepresented in engineering , and by making project findings available to a wide audience through an open-source materials library. < br/ > < br/ > Current soft wearable devices are bulky and impractical because they need stiff frames to ensure load transmission . The pixel-like control of material properties afforded by multi-material and multi-stitch knit textiles , on the other hand , can redirect force transmission to precise deformation modes efficiently and with a low profile . This project approaches designing , fabricating , and testing knit-enabled wearable devices in three thrusts . The first thrust will model and optimize knits to achieve target load and deformation profiles by using a combination of experimental material characterization and multiscale modeling to harness the full capabilities of the modern knitting process . The second thrust will design , fabricate , and test wearable pneumatic devices , including consideration for donning and doffing , actuator integration and interfacing , and device characterization . The third thrust will implement and test social touch cues using the device with pre-programmed haptic emojis and display of teleoperated social touch queues in real time . Taken together , these thrusts will create new forms of communication and lead to increased capabilities of wearable devices that improve human health and quality of life. < br/ > < br/ > This award reflects NSF 's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation 's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria ."

2318751,Info Integration & Informatics,Kevin Xu,CAREER : Model-based Analysis of Dynamic Networks using Continuous-time Network Models,10/1/22,"Networks are all around us in many forms , ranging from online social networks to public transportation networks to gene networks in biology . Most networks change over time and are often called temporal or dynamic networks . In this project , a framework for modeling and analyzing dynamic networks that change continuously over time will be developed , even though the networks may only be periodically observed . This framework advances the interdisciplinary field of network science along with the computer and information sciences by developing models to separate the underlying dynamics of the networks from the times at which the networks are observed . The framework can be applied to analyze dynamic network data in many scientific disciplines and in public health applications , including networks of face-to-face interactions between people , which can help scientists better understand the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 . This project advances education in network science by creating a curriculum for instruction of dynamic networks at the undergraduate and graduate levels . The project also trains new graduate and undergraduate students , including female students from the University of Toledo 's ACM-W chapter , in interdisciplinary data science research . Finally , the project develops and integrates methods for analyzing dynamic networks into the open-source DyNetworkX Python package to reach others who could use them in impactful ways. < br/ > < br/ > Temporal dynamics in networks are known to provide crucial information about the underlying complex systems being modeled by the networks . While significant advances have been made towards understanding the structure of static networks , dynamics are usually incorporated in an ad-hoc manner by creating discrete time snapshots aggregated over some arbitrary time period , primarily for convenience of analysis . The goal of this project is to develop a unified framework for model-based analysis of dynamic networks using continuous-time models that can be applied to both discrete- and continuous-time dynamic network data . Towards this goal , the research team will target five specific aims : 1 ) learning continuous-time network models from aggregated counts of relational events over time , 2 ) creating Hawkes process-based generative models for timestamped events with durations , 3 ) developing kernel smoothing approaches for analyzing dynamic networks , 4 ) modeling different types of measurement error in dynamic network data , and 5 ) creating time- and memory-efficient dynamic graph data structures to enable analysis of large dynamic networks with high temporal resolution . Dynamics of networks are given minimal coverage in current network science curricula and textbooks . The model-based analysis techniques to be developed in this project build upon fundamental network theory and empirical observations about real networks and are thus ideal for integration into a typical graduate or undergraduate network science course . The investigator will develop a publicly-available curriculum for instruction on dynamic network representations , models , and analysis methods . The results of this project will provide a glimpse of the possibilities enabled by continuous-time network models and guide future research and education efforts on dynamic networks. < br/ > < br/ > This award reflects NSF 's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation 's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria ."
2239537,Info Integration & Informatics,Mingchen Gao,CAREER : Deploying Transferable Medical Imaging Diagnosis System in Diverse Environments,7/1/23,"Medical imaging , such as Computed Tomography ( CT ) , Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) , chest X-ray , and retinal imaging , are valuable tools to assist in diagnosis . Medical imaging analysis has been significantly advanced using deep learning models . The knowledge extracted from large amounts of medical data can be used to make predictions for new patients . It has been demonstrated in many cases that the performances of machine learning models are comparable to board-certified radiologists or other professional experts , indicating the potential successful integration of those models in clinical applications . For example , imagine a patient notices a painless rash on their skin . If they could take a photo with a cell phone and receive a quick assessment comparable to experienced dermatologists , life-threatening diseases would be intervened or avoided early . However , the current success of deep learning is heavily dependent on large and high-quality labeled datasets . Such nearly perfect environments are only available in ideal lab environments because of the population shift , device differences , or rare diseases in real clinical applications . This project plans to focus on those specific challenges of non-ideal medical imaging diagnosis environments to advance the knowledge of building transferrable deep learning models and enhance national health by providing better tools for medical imaging diagnosis . Furthermore , this research will support the cross-disciplinary development of a diverse cohort of Ph.D. and undergraduate students and outreach activities to diverse communities. < br/ > < br/ > Technically , this project will investigate and build transferable medical imaging diagnosis systems in diverse environments . The project proceeds with one overarching theme of leveraging the understudied geometric properties of deep neural networks to address three universal barriers when deploying medical imaging systems in various environments . Specifically , there are challenges to transferring models to novel classes , where there are not enough training samples , and novel domains , where the deploying environments change , and more importantly , preserving the previous knowledge in the model . If successful , the proposed research is expected to advance the understanding of building transferring deep learning models by leveraging a novel geometric interpretation of deep neural networks partitioning the input and feature space into generalized Voronoi diagrams . The driving applications of the proposed techniques are the prediction of long-tailed disease patterns on chest X-rays and ensuring consistent screening services for glaucoma in underserved communities . In addition , the proposed methods have the potential to be extended to similar scenarios with diverse deployment environments. < br/ > < br/ > This award reflects NSF 's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation 's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria ."

Online platforms make it easier for workers to find short-term work and for employers to hire freelancers for their short-term needs . Such short-term work arrangements offer workers the independence and flexibility they desire , while at the same time allowing companies to momentarily tap into external knowledge and experiences their workforce lacks . However , short-term workers today exist on the fringes of their temporary workplaces and find it challenging to build social connections within the organizations that hire them , affecting both their well-being and productivity negatively . Workers from minority or marginalized groups are particularly impacted negatively . This project will develop a research program that accelerates assimilation into future work settings through a unique partnership with two industry collaborators , who operate at very different scales and rely on freelancers to varying degrees : one partner is a small business with fewer than a hundred permanent employees , the other partner is a large , multinational information-technology and research company that operates in many countries . In coordination with these partners , the researchers will organize a series of workshops to create a focused research agenda that is beneficial for workers and organizations broadly . Based on this agenda , the project team will include diverse stakeholders , such as industry representatives , workers , and researchers , who can then make progress on this research agenda . This planned research will also train graduate students across multiple disciplines , including computer science , social sciences , and organizational science . Given the central emphasis on inclusion and access , the project will place particular emphasis on recruiting women , students of color , and first-generation students to contribute to this research . < br/ > < br/ > This project brings together several disciplines , including learning science , computer science , and social psychology . The intellectual contribution of this proposal is to establish the requirements and key technological affordances of a work environment for rapid assimilation through social learning . This is done by focusing on the design of socialization tools for remote gig workers . The research is highly integrative and converges expertise from social/behavioral sciences and computer/learning science . The team is structured to achieve multiple convergent goals : To address the need for rapid assimilation of on-demand workers into organizations , this research will uncover the social and technical needs for digital and physical environments that accelerate newcomer situated learning and assimilation . Second , it will build a diverse and cross-disciplinary team to build such environments in planned future research . Finally , this project will positively impact a highly skilled , and economically significant workforce of information workers at large , and the project 's research agenda is likely to particularly help female and underrepresented workers be more included in the workforce .

Spatial resolution of biomedical images , however , sometimes do not suffice for specific applications due to constraints of image acquisition time . Conventional software-based improvement bears high costs in computation and visualization , opening a niche to optimize the framework towards super-resolution at reasonable costs . It aligns with NSF ? s mission to promote the process of computer science and to advance the national health . This project is to investigate novel algorithm development to adaptively improve digital resolution and minimize the cost of computation in super-resolution process . Technically , this method combines the effort of object detection and super-resolution to bring a generalizable tool to potentially benefit multiple biomedical imaging modalities , such as optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) , histological microscopy , confocal images , MRI , ultrasound , etc . The educational emphasizes activities to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in biomedical pursuits. < br/ > < br/ > This project aims to develop intelligent object-adaptive super-resolution algorithms to improve resolutions of biomedical images in a robust , efficient , and generalizable manner . This project will develop robust object detection neural network to identify regions to be super-resolved . A scale factor will be determined for adaptive super-resolution . This project will investigate on computationally efficient algorithms to super-resolve biomedical images to multiple scale factors during a complex-valued image reconstruction process . This project will also develop a transferrable framework such that the super-resolution technology developed in one image modality can be adapted into the super-resolution technology developed by a different imaging modality . The approaches will be validated using OCT data and the domain adaption will be validated by transferring from OCT domain to histopathological domain . The research outcome will also result in artificial intelligence-based educational materials and software to reduce the need of biomedical facilities that are conventionally required but not cost-effective to underrepresented groups .

2323384,Robust Intelligence,Scott Niekum,CAREER : Safe and Efficient Robot Learning from Demonstration in the Real World,1/1/23,"General purpose robots are poised to enter the home and workplace in unprecedented numbers in coming years , but face the significant challenge of customization - the ability to perform user-specified tasks in many different unstructured environments . In response to this need , robot learning from demonstration ( LfD ) has emerged as a paradigm that allows users to quickly and naturally program robots by simply showing them how to perform a task , rather than by writing code . This methodology aims to allow non-expert users to program robots , as well as communicate embodied knowledge that is difficult to translate into formal code . However , current state-of-the-art LfD algorithms are not yet ready for widespread deployment , as they are often unreliable , need too much data , and are designed to learn in a single session in a laboratory setting . This work addresses these issues to help enable future robots to perform important tasks ranging from in-home elderly care to reconfigurable manufacturing. < br/ > < br/ > Specifically , this work identifies three significant technical improvements to current LfD algorithms that are needed before they can be deployed in the real world : the need for safety guarantees , the ability to learn from very limited amounts of data , and the ability to continually improve in an ongoing , life-long fashion . A formal theory of safe LfD is developed , along with practical algorithms that provide strong probabilistic lower bounds on agent performance . Algorithmic efficiency is addressed via a re-examining of common statistical assumptions ( such as independent and identically distributed data ) and through the use of multimodal side-information , such as natural language and gaze . Finally , active learning strategies and modeling of human beliefs are used to enable interactive , continual learning. < br/ > < br/ > This award reflects NSF 's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation 's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria ."
2237097,HCC-Human-Centered Computing,Zhan Zhang,CAREER : Co-Designing Hands-Free Cognitive Aids with Fast-Paced Medical Teams,6/1/23,"Humans have limited capacity for processing information and recognizing critical events , which can lead to errors when this capacity is exceeded . In safety-critical areas such as medicine , such errors can lead to serious consequences , especially in the many cases where these errors might be preventable . A common cause of medical errors is when health workers lack situational awareness -- knowing what is going on within an environment and predicting what is likely to happen next -- and make mistakes based on this lack of awareness . This project looks to reduce these mistakes through developing novel computing and interaction techniques that support situational awareness for physically and cognitively preoccupied health workers who are part of emergency medical services ( EMS ) teams that provide urgent medical care in the field . The research team will work closely with EMS providers to understand their cognitive needs and develop hands-free , minimally distracting cognitive aids that support their situational awareness and decision-making in fast-paced crisis response situations . < br/ > < br/ > The overarching goal of this research is to determine how to support fast-response medical teams ? awareness of context-specific information and activities while accounting for their limited capacity in processing information and ability to interact with handheld computing devices while doing their job .

As smart learning companions ( for example , animated intelligent characters/agents ) become popular , children are at risk of overestimating and over-trusting AI given their tendency to anthropomorphize such intelligent systems . This CAREER project investigates the development of novel embodied learning technologies that help K-12 students demystify machine learning ( ML ) , an integral aspect of current approaches to AI . The project will provide hands-on and collaborative learning experiences for children to make sense of the inner workings of ML , similar to how they build , act , and experiment in collaboration with friends . The learning experiences will be designed to be accessible to children , regardless of their math and computing background , with special attention to those from historically underrepresented backgrounds in STEM . The project outcomes will advance an AI-driven society by preparing 21st century learners to become critical thinkers about AI , as both consumers and future creators . It will also promote inclusion in next-generation STEM education by addressing AI inequality in life and work . < br/ > < br/ > AI and ML are often presented to children as a black box , focusing on workflows and capabilities ( e.g. , data training , image and voice recognition ) which can lead to inaccurate or oversimplified understandings . Further , many K-12 students lack math and computing backgrounds that are required for understanding abstract Machine Learning ( ML ) concepts and methods . To address these challenges in understanding abstract ML concepts , this project will explore the design space of 3D and tangible interaction technologies to provide embodied learning experiences that draw upon children 's real-life experience of object manipulation , body movement and role-play . Knowledge discovery will be accelerated through a pedagogical agent with curiosity-eliciting prompts to encourage exploratory learning . The learning experiences will be evaluated for impact in supporting knowledge acquisition , self-efficacy and interest in ML with elementary and middle school students . Findings of this project are expected to : ( 1 ) deepen knowledge of embodied and exploratory learning in supporting the understanding of abstract and complex STEM concepts through the lens of ML education ; and , ( 2 ) inform the design of future learning technologies that seamlessly integrate sensorimotor enactment and situated social prompts to make K-12 ML education highly accessible to students with diverse backgrounds and skills. < br/ > < br/ > This award reflects NSF 's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation 's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria ."

For example , when a user visits an online retailer , the products shown are selected by a recommender system designed to help one find things to buy and to increase the vendors sales . Recommender systems are also behind most online news sources , and they can shape which news people see . Given the importance of recommender systems to individual choice , it is critical for researchers to be able to carry out studies to evaluate different designs and their impact on the users of the system . But conducting such studies is beyond the resources of most researchers . To get meaningful results requires building and sustaining a community of willing users who have given their permission to be studied . As a result , the amount of experimental research ? and specifically experimental research on long-term users of a system ? has plummeted . Almost all such studies are conducted by commercial recommendation platforms and their results are rarely made known to the public . This project is designed to develop a shared news recommender system specifically to enable researchers nationwide to be able to carry out experiments and learn just how different algorithms and interfaces affect users . This should create the knowledge that will allow the community to fully understand the impact of these systems and design new recommender systems that can enhance fairness and equity . When complete , this research infrastructure will support researchers in answering critical questions about how complex and often opaque recommender systems affect user behavior and to test new systems that can improve these systems and their outcomes. < br/ > < br/ > This community-centered project will design and build an experimental news recommender community infrastructure to support research in personalization and recommender systems , AI and machine learning , natural language processing , human-computer interaction , social computing , and other fields that would benefit from the ability to carry out online field experiments with long-term users of a system . The cloud-based software infrastructure includes a pluggable recommendation architecture in which researchers can deploy custom algorithms and interfaces , a feed of news articles starting with those obtained through a partnership with the Associated Press , experiment-support modules including consent , payment , and surveying of subjects , and support for two news interfaces ? first a news digest and then a progressive web news browser . The infrastructure will maintain a set of long-term consented users , provide extensive support to researchers including overarching IRB protocols , training , sample experiments , datasets and metrics , and live support through a researcher support team . It will be governed by a community advisory board drawn from the researcher community with representatives of the content providers and end-users and charged with allocating experiment slots and steering the development and management of the infrastructure . By developing and deploying this research infrastructure , the investigators seek to empower individuals and small groups to study important questions in recommender systems , including questions about how different algorithms and interfaces can alter the diversity of sources and viewpoints represented and provide users with greater understanding and control over the content they explore . The investigators come from five institutions spread across the country and will in turn assemble and train a diverse team to take on this technically challenging and important work. < br/ > < br/ > This award reflects NSF 's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation 's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria ."

To address this challenge , fifty humanoid robots ( called `` Quori '' ) will be built . The Quori robots developed will be distributed to research teams across the United States . These robots will serve as a standardized robot platform to create a robotics community infrastructure to advance scientific robotics research . This effort builds on the success of a previous project that designed , built , and tested ten prototype Quori robots , and awarded them to a small selection of U.S. research teams . The current project incorporates the lessons learned from the prototype Quori development to improve the design of the robot , adapt it to make it easier to manufacture at scale , and distribute it to a broader set of research teams . The project connects students and researchers who use the Quori robots through online collaboration tools , regular events , and opportunities to work together . This will build a community of roboticists across the country that can learn from each others ' work , share ideas , and allow for rapid advancement of research in robotics .

The risk of overdose is particularly high following a period of abstinence leading to drug-related deaths . OUD includes physical dependency and neural adaptations in brain circuits of reward and motivation , self-regulation , and stress reactivity that can persist years after drug discontinuation . Substance craving is one of the primary causes of OUD patient 's relapse . Studies have shown psychological cues such as stress , anxiety , and arousal can precipitate the cultivation of drug craving . Research has found that mindfulness-based strategies reduce cravings , psychological cues and prevent relapse . Mindfulness-based interventions ( MBIs ) bring about clinically relevant changes to physiological arousal , stress , and addictive behavior through cognitive behavioral skill development . This project focuses on developing and testing innovative technologies to aid sustainable recovery of OUD with wearable and in-home physiological monitoring and generation of adaptive , personalized , and just-in-time MBIs . While the research is focused on OUD , the principle and the outcomes can be expanded to include other substance use disorders .

In particular , the research tasks focus on there areas . First , effective physiological feature identification and extraction to detect craving that is generalizable across large OUD populations and consider the external factors such as age , gender , drug use habits , etc . Second , development of an effective multi-modal sensing integration approach to capture psychological craving cues ( e.g. , stress , arousal ) from a combination of acoustic and physiological sensing . This will include novel multiple instance ( MIL ) multitask learning based classification techniques that are scalable with near real-time performance . The study will address the fundamental gaps of indoor craving-relevant sensing where only a small fraction of a long signal may convey information relevant to the targeted emotional state/class .

To construct these programs , software developers must divide each problem into smaller operations and order those operations carefully to compute the correct answer . This ordering can be viewed as a network graph , where each operation points to its next possible operations in order . Furthermore , to make these programs run fast enough to be useful , developers , engineers , and researchers must find new ways to balance those operations with system resources such as storage , processing units , and memory . These resource constraints add more ordering requirements to the graph . Verifying this graph can help avoid bugs . Information inferred from this graph can be used to automatically decrease the time the program requires to run . Thus , people working in computing frequently examine these graphs to generate or validate new ideas about how to write their programs or use computational resources . For example , a programmer may discover a long sequence of operations performed one after another that could be parallelized , thus making the program faster . General approaches for drawing networks have not met the demand of graphs in the computing space , resulting in difficult to interpret , if not unusable , diagrams .

Similarly , differences in the genomes of bacteria and viruses help to determine their specific characteristics such as , for example , whether they are harmful to humans or animals . These genetic differences are important to understand and to take into account when studying the biology of an organism because they play such an important role in how even individual cells in the organism function . Advances in genome sequencing technology have generated huge catalogs of such differences in many organisms , including humans . These rich repositories of genomic information can not be fully integrated and analyzed due to a lack of effective computational methods , and existing methods suffer from computational inefficiencies and lapses of accuracy when drawing conclusions from collections of genomic differences . This project will develop new computational methods to increase accuracy and decrease computational resource requirements for storing , comparing , and evaluating catalogs of genomic differences . It will result in new scientific software that will better organize catalogs of differences to make computational analyses more tractable . It will also result in software that more accurately measures the diversity of a population of individuals and software that supports making better comparisons between populations . The project will validate these methods by subtyping cancer tumors , assessing the diversity of cells in various types of tumors , and by comparing populations of bacteria found in different environments . The project will result in faster , more accurate software for the analysis of many genomic differences that will advance our understanding of how genomic variants affect human health and biological processes . To better explain the innovations developed during this project and the importance of studying genomic differences , the project will also produce a series of educational videos that will help other people understand the main ideas behind the techniques developed in this project. < br/ > < br/ > Genome graphs have emerged as an important data structure in the analysis of collections of genomic variants . These are graphs in which nodes ( or edges ) are labeled with genomic sequences ( strings ) and paths in the graph represent substrings that are present in the population that the graph represents . They can be used as representations of a ? reference ? genome for a population of organisms . Genome graphs have been used to reduce bias in the reference genome , form more inclusive reference genomes , and to reduce space and time requirements to perform genomic sequence analyses . For this reason , many tools are being adapted to use genome graphs as references in lieu of traditional linear ( single sequence ) references . While genome graphs have consistently proved useful in these areas , the algorithms for a number of problems associated with them suffer from poor computational scaling and lack of formalization . The project will develop and validate algorithms for several central genome graph problems , specifically to ( goal 1 ) construct genome graphs , to ( goal 2 ) compare genome graphs , and to ( goal 3 ) assess the complexity of genome graphs . The framework that the project will use to solve these problems is innovative in that it involves exploiting the under-explored connection between graph flow decompositions and genome graphs . This approach reveals natural relationships between genome graphs and the population of strings they represent . This global view of the expressive power of a genome graph is central to the formulations that the project will explore . The problems that the project will tackle bridge graph theory and genomics , leading to greater interactions and connections between those fields . Our algorithms will allow genome graphs to more accurately reflect desired populations , will allow information from multiple genomes to be better integrated , and will advance the informatics tools needed to exploit large collections of genomic variants . The project will apply and evaluate these algorithms to ( 1 ) improve sequence alignment for mapping populations of genomes , ( 2 ) improve clustering of cancer tumor sequences and metagenomic samples , and ( 3 ) better model the progression of heterogeneity in metastatic cancer samples . The developed algorithms will be implemented in an open-source library to encourage their use in other systems . Finally , the project will create open-source , free instructional videos to introduce concepts such as pan-genomics , genome graphs , and the developed algorithms to a wider audience. < br/ > < br/ > This award reflects NSF 's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation 's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria ."

For example , images from unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) , satellites , and reconnaissance cameras lack stereo information causing 3D reconstruction and depth estimation to fail . Turbulence caused by air and water also causes light rays to deflect from their original path and introduces noticeable motion artifacts like blurriness and distortion . This project develops a generalizable motion field estimator using neural networks coupled with specific hardware settings to enhance computer vision tasks in long-range imaging . Successful development of such a motion field estimator can enable applications of computer vision systems at long distances and/or under turbulent environments including UAV navigation , object tracking and detection , and long-range monitoring . The project has broader impact in industrial applications which leverage such technologies .

Prolonged stay increases patients ? risk of hospital-acquired infections and disrupts patient flow and access to high-quality healthcare services . As such , a model that can reliably predict the length of stay for a specific patient is desirable to mitigate the prolonged stay and guide personalized decision-making . However , the length of stay can be affected by a multitude of factors and can vary based on different patients ? conditions and disease progression . The complex and dynamic nature of massive clinical data , not to mention the presence of a large portion of missing and censored values in the healthcare data , poses significant challenges for efficient modeling and dynamic prediction . This project aims to offer an integrated solution by establishing a pipeline consisting of advanced statistical modeling , monitoring , and deep learning techniques based on patient information collected from heterogeneous medical systems over time . The success of the project will catalyze a transition from a traditional standard-driven discharge scheduling service to a data-driven proactive scheduling paradigm . The success of the project will alleviate the hospital ? s pressure on resource allocation and improve patient flow and , more importantly , pandemic preparedness . The project can provide opportunities for research-based interdisciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate students in health informatics , statistics , and artificial intelligence from diverse backgrounds , including women and underrepresented minorities. < br/ > < br/ > < br/ > This project will address the critical challenges of healthcare data analysis , i.e. , heterogeneity , multi-modality , and data sparsity . Conventional data-driven methods have been predominantly focused on identifying the factors that strongly influence the length of stay as opposed to predicting the length of stay itself . Moreover , the existing approaches failed to address the inherent uncertainty and were incapable of incorporating different data modalities and dynamic prediction . The project proposes a personalized framework by integration of advanced tensor fusion and time-to-event modeling techniques towards smart patient flow management , which ultimately allows for faster achievement of health outcomes and reduction of hospitalized costs . The proposed intelligent framework will advance the state-of-art research of real-time data fusion and personalized prognosis in the following aspects : ( 1 ) brings the data fusion and length of stay prediction into a unified framework ; ( 2 ) facilitates personalized length of stay prediction in a real-time manner ; ( 3 ) naturally has the capability to incorporate uncertainties in the decision-making process to provide a confident and intelligent scheduling service . Although the methodology is proposed for the patient length of stay prediction , it does not depend on any restrictive assumptions of domain knowledge and specific disease and thus can potentially be applied to a broad range of events predictions. < br/ > < br/ > This award reflects NSF 's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation 's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria ."

The sequencing of genomic data found in nature is now democratized , opening the door to a digital library of countless documents of evolutionary history . In parallel , the synthesis of engineered DNA for widespread societal benefits is now automated and affordable , showing incredible promise in recent years . Indeed , recent advances in reading and writing DNA have the potential to resolve major global challenges , such as boosting crop yield to address food shortages , mitigating pollution through carbon capture , and improving pandemic response and preparedness . While these remarkable technological advances can be used for broad societal benefit , they are underutilized for tracking yet-unseen pathogens that can result in widespread economic and public harm . Our ability to read and write DNA at scale , especially with respect to uncovering yet-unseen pathogens and intentionally or unintentionally enhancing existing pathogens , has far outstripped computational tools capable of tracking and preventing misuse . To address this critical gap , the research detailed in this proposal will focus on developing computational tools to aid in detecting yet-unseen pathogens and preventing intentional or unintentional misuse of synthetic DNA . < br/ > < br/ > This project will advocate for a novel paradigm of pathogen detection and monitoring through the pursuit of innovative computational methods and approaches . The research methodology will be motivated by tried and tested approaches in biosurveillance while pursuing innovative computational strategies . Specifically , this project will address four fundamental computational research challenges : ( 1 ) yet-unseen pathogen characterization -- contextualizing taxonomy-based approaches with functions of concern to learn how to identify novel pathogens , ( 2 ) petabyte-scale cataloging of microbial dark matter -- combining probabilistic algorithm development with comparative genomic approaches for the query of known and rare microbial genes , ( 3 ) genetic engineering detection -- discerning engineered DNA from naturally occurring DNA through the development of graph-based pan genomes combined with codon usage bias models , and ( 4 ) implementation of the modular computational platform GuarDNA -- integrating everything together into the first-ever comprehensive platform specifically designed for both biosecurity and biosurveillance . GuarDNA will be designed following software engineering best practices , with code modularity as a key focus to facilitate community engagement . These four research challenges will be accompanied by a comprehensive test and evaluation plan , which both provides an individual assessment of each of the four research thrusts as well as continuous integration testing to provide an overarching evaluation of the GuarDNA platform .

However , disruptions and transitions of routines , such as moving , job changes , or family illness , can interfere with their ability to stick to their goals . When these transitions happen , they might influence how individuals access healthy eating resources or create challenges for people to maintain their healthy eating behavior outside their established routine . Transitions may also create new needs or change people ? s priorities around healthy eating . However , current personal informatics technology is typically designed based on the assumption that everyday behavior remains static . As a result , when transitions happen in everyday life , existing technologies struggle to help people assess and adapt to the changing needs , constraints , and priorities . Thus , this project aims to examine how personal informatics systems can be designed to support people in healthy eating when experiencing transitions in their routines , individually and collaboratively . < br/ > < br/ > The initial line of work will be to systematically understand people ? s needs and the challenges of healthy eating when transitions in their routines occur . These findings will help create design principles and theoretical foundations supporting technology design around these transitions . The second line of work will iteratively design and develop technologies that can support people to cope with transitions and continue to eat healthily . Finally , the project team will conduct field studies to evaluate the usefulness , usability , and engagement with these technologies over time and in the context of transitions .

However , crucial information for database tuning is often available in the form of natural language text , including , for instance , the database manual , text documents describing data sets , as well as discussions on database-centric Internet forums . Currently , automated tools are unable to benefit from such text , making them inefficient . This project aims at creating automated database tuning tools that extract useful information for tuning from a variety of text documents . By increasing the quality of automated tuning tools , the project empowers lay users and reduces the need for highly specialized workers in industry , currently causing staff shortages and hampering the adoption of new technology . At the same time , the project aims at the creation of new teaching offerings , helping to educate the next generation of data professionals. < br/ > < br/ > < br/ > The project is divided into two primary research thrusts , dedicated to the two categories of text documents that are most useful for database system tuning : text about data sets and text about database management systems .

More than a quarter of people living in the United States in 2014 had a disability , and 24.2 million people aged 18 or older required assistance with activities of daily living such as feeding , bathing , transferring , dressing , toileting , and ambulating . Caregiving robots have the potential to help increase or prolong user independence while reducing caregiver burden . However , there are hardly any caregiving robots that provide long-term care for performing activities of daily living , currently . One of the primary reasons is the fundamental limitation to which robots can reason about physical contact which is essential to perform these activities . Therefore , our key insight is to leverage this physical contact instead of avoiding them and to learn safe and efficient physical interactions while empowering the users . This Faculty Early Career Development ( CAREER ) project focuses on learning robot control policies that leverage physical contact during the activities of robot-assisted feeding and bed-bathing while empowering the users themselves with decision-making capabilities for assisting care recipients with Spinal Cord Injury. < br/ > < br/ > The goal of this project is to develop fundamental capabilities towards reshaping the field of robotic physical caregiving by designing control policies that leverage varied multimodal physical interactions to perform activities of daily living ( ADL ) safely and efficiently . This also entails addressing perception and action uncertainty in unstructured environments by empowering the users to make critical decisions without completely relying on full but fragile autonomy . The fields of assistive robotics and physical human-robot interaction have primarily focused on deliberate contact at the end-effector using carefully controlled actions that are optimized for sensing . This does not capture the realistic scenarios of physical caregiving that may require reasoning about incidental and/or distributed contacts . This project aims to cover this gap and takes the first steps towards translating laboratory research in robotic physical caregiving to real-world deployment . The research plan is organized into three thrusts where the first thrust focuses on designing autonomous control policies that use multimodal sensory inputs for safe and efficient robotic physical caregiving . The second thrust brings users in the loop to augment autonomous control policies and empowers the users by including them in the critical decision-making process . Finally , the third thrust focuses on designing control policies for robotic caregiving that can adapt to a user 's changing cognitive workload .

In the context of rendering , typically an image is generated through random sampling using what are known as Monte Carlo ( MC ) algorithms , simulating how the photons emitted from the light sources interact with the objects in the virtual environment and arrive at the camera . Accurate reconstruction of an image , however , requires simulating a large number of photons , making this approach costly in terms of computational power and energy consumption . This project will dramatically reduce the number of photons required to obtain a high-quality image , thereby significantly reducing the cost . This objective is achieved by novel ways of finding high-likelihood photon paths and by enhancing the quality of the image after rendering . Project outcomes will have broad impact on applications such as those mentioned above , as well as in areas beyond graphics that also rely on MC integration . Educational and outreach activities will use compelling real-world problems and concepts in computer graphics , particularly rendering , as motivational tools to get people of diverse ages and demographic backgrounds excited about STEM. < br/ > < br/ > This research will focus on accelerating the convergence of MC rendering by developing novel methods that operate during or after rendering . The two most common categories of methods used in this setting are importance sampling ( during ) and reconstruction/denoising ( after ) . Unfortunately , the majority of existing importance sampling techniques provide path guidance locally and thereby ignore the model error on future points along the path . Moreover , current state-of-the-art reconstruction/denoising methods use a neural network trained on a set of noisy images and their corresponding ground truth , and the performance of these methods on test images that lie outside the distribution of the training data can be suboptimal . This project addresses these challenges by introducing novel frameworks that view these problems in a fundamentally different way . The specific research objectives are twofold : ( 1 ) To guide the paths according to distributions that are estimated in an error-aware manner , which requires introducing a global objective function that takes the entire path into consideration . ( 2 ) To design denoising systems that can be adapted to the test example at hand , by posing the denoising problem as an optimization problem and developing novel objectives that work effectively without the need for ground truth images. < br/ > < br/ > This award reflects NSF 's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation 's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria ."

However , ? prevention is better than cure ? as prevention and early intervention will prevent the aging people from suffering more diseases and/or more extensive treatments . Also , it is too late to build the prediction model when a lot of patients have been observed in the late stage of a progressive disease , which severely damages their health . Meanwhile , in order to be usable by healthcare providers , the prediction model needs to be interpretable and trustable . Also , efficient interaction between human stakeholders ( e.g. , developers , domain experts and/or end-users ) and clear model interpretation not only improve the model performance but also enhance human trust . The proposed research project aims at developing algorithms and methods that support implementation of trustworthy and time-efficient data-driven decision making for prevention and early intervention. < br/ > < br/ > The main approach proposed in this project is interactive explainable deep survival analysis . Survival analysis aims at predicting the time to event of interest , which is extremely beneficial in healthcare for modeling disease progression , identifying prognostic factors , assessing risk of health . This project will build deep survival analysis models in healthy aging and precision medicine to support clinical decision making , especially in the early stage of a progressive disease before a lot of patients have been suffered from that disease . Deep survival analysis is a kind of ? black box ? model that stakeholders can not tell how the model operates and how it comes to its decisions and hence limits its usage in practice . This project will develop methods to achieve both transparency and trustworthiness in deep survival analysis models with encoding of domain knowledge and expert feedback to achieve better prediction performance .

Every day , people work with highly autonomous systems in operational environments , such as teaming with robots in warehouse distribution facilities or flying an airplane . If a person 's trust in the autonomy is too high or low relative to its capability , the person may rely on it too much or not use it at all . Trust changes over time as someone interacts with the autonomous system and learns its capabilities . However , the person 's lack of awareness of their own trust influences behavior , and as a result impacts performance and safety . It is difficult to measure someone 's trust while they are doing these tasks because accurate measurements of trust often disrupt the work being done . If trust can be measured continuously over time , the person 's interaction with the autonomous system can be made safer and more efficient . Given the increased use of autonomy across sectors including manufacturing , aerospace , the tech industry , and military , continuous measures of trust may impact US economy and security . Further , there is a need to prepare a diverse , technically trained workforce for advanced operational environments . People who will be working with autonomous systems are often not trained on the importance of trust and how it may change over time . Further , there are currently limited opportunities for underserved and underrepresented populations to enter this in-demand workforce . < br/ > < br/ > To address these needs , the project contributes to fundamental understanding of trust in operational environments by modeling trust dynamics from physiological signals . Changes in trust manifest as physiological responses , which can be detected by monitoring the heart , eye , skin , and brain . While there is increasing interest in physiological monitoring to estimate trust , this work has been constrained to the laboratory under ideal conditions and has yet to be successful applied to operational environments . This project has four Research Goals ( R # ) . R1 models initial trust with physiological features used to predict operators ' self-reported trust . R2 assesses learned trust dynamics after repeated interactions with autonomy . R3 investigates trust calibration by assessing operators ' trust dynamics when the reliability of the autonomous agent shifts . R4 seeks to understand the utility of wearable sensors to model trust in operational environments . Two demonstration environments are used : a person working with a simulated robot to fill orders in a distribution warehouse , and a person flying an aircraft with the assistance of an automated flight planner . The education component of this project has two educational goals ( E # ) to train the human-autonomous teaming ( HAT ) workforce on the importance of trust and engage the next generation of HAT researchers and operators . E1 trains operators on the importance of trust for workplace safety and performance through educational modules for HAT operators . It also informs the research goals through a series of operator interviews to define the task used in this research . E2 increases access and engagement in STEM in Colorado . The key effort in E2 administers experiential learning modules called Traveling Trunks , which are easy-to-administer lessons that use HAT as a hook to increase student interest .

A key area is learning motor or physical skills of tremendous practical ( such as training for surgery ) , scientific ( such as understanding motor memory ) and cultural ( such as music and sports ) interest . To learn new motor skills or recover them after an injury , people often need intensive training or rehabilitation therapy with an expert who can instruct , assess performance , provide feedback , support , and motivate . Working with an expert can ensure learners achieve desired results , exercise correctly , avoid injury , and gain insights into their own performance . But an expert may not always be accessible or available , particularly in situations where demand for experts exceeds supply or when people have personal , monetary , or geographic limitations that prevent access . To deal with the absence of an expert , alternatives for learning at home include books , videos , apps , and online services ( such as ClassPass , Peloton , Mirror ) . Although these options successfully provide explanations and demonstrations , none of them can provide meaningful real-time feedback to the trainees . This project leverages recent advances in Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) and eXtended Reality ( XR ) technologies to build new types of interactive motor skill training and rehabilitation systems where users receive real-time feedback from AI agents represented as 3D avatars . By building AI agents that emulate the real-time verbal and non-verbal behaviors of a human expert , the project will provide foundational knowledge on underlying principles that govern human-AI interactions in the context of motor skill learning ( specifically , rehabilitation therapy ) . The project has the potential to broaden access to motor skill learning and rehabilitation at home by reducing financial or psychological barriers at low cost , with low intrusion , and at scale . Given that algorithms are increasingly making inroads into societally consequential domains , understanding how humans and AI agents interact has broad potential implications for the design of responsible and explainable AI . < br/ > < br/ > The goal of this project is to investigate the design of AI-XR ( artificial intelligence - extended reality ) systems for motor skill learning and rehab . Specifically , the project advances a new human-AI interface paradigm in which the AI is represented as a 3D humanoid agent in XR that can mimic the real-time verbal and non-verbal behaviors of a human trainer to support motor learning in the absence of a human expert . Human expert trainers make use of multimodal feedback through visual , auditory , and haptic channels when providing the necessary explanations , demonstrations , and corrections of physical motion performance .

Developing AI agents for motor learning therefore presents numerous technical and generalizable research challenges , including ( i ) how to design effective multimodal instruction and feedback mechanisms and ( ii ) how to enable natural interactions between the user and an AI agent . To tackle these challenges , the project will implement new ( i ) algorithms and AI models for comprehensive body motion and error analysis ; ( ii ) multimodal instruction and feedback techniques ; and ( iii ) applications for fitness training and rehab that demonstrate the new human-AI interaction paradigm . The AI agent and system designs will be evaluated by performing controlled experiments with users . The evaluation of this research project will be through three applications for : ( 1 ) physical fitness , ( 2 ) sports injury rehabilitation , and ( 3 ) facial paralysis rehabilitation . Implementations of parts of this research in play- and peer-based educational activities for middle and high school students will be designed to be interactive and engaging , while eliciting problem solving and critical thinking .

They usually do not model the underlying physical process ( e.g. , light transport or dynamics ) directly , they require significant computational resources for training and inference , and they are difficult to debug and control . On the other hand , while classical visual computing algorithms that explicitly model the formation of visual data ( e.g. , how a camera captures a picture or how objects move physically ) suffer less from these issues , they often do not apply as broadly as modern machine learning methods because they do not learn from a large amount of experience .

This project aims to leverage an emerging understanding of communication behavior , along with techniques from network science , economics , and natural language processing , to increase the chance that people successfully bridge these differences and form stronger cooperative and civic ties. < br/ > < br/ > To achieve its goals , the project will develop models of intergroup communication and the influence of cooperation in social networks to inform interventions that improve communication and cooperation in online contexts . The investigators will first develop an experimental system to examine communication and connection patterns for cooperation under circumstances where there is group identity in human networks . Then , the team will iteratively design algorithms that use natural language processing and conversational AI techniques , along with network science and user modeling methods , to suggest conversation partners , topics , and styles that may help people make connections across groups more effectively . These will be tested with a combination of laboratory and field studies to measure the effectiveness of the developed interventions with robust causality and external validity . Together , the project will improve understanding of how technology might help a diverse society such as ours operate more effectively. < br/ > < br/ > This award reflects NSF 's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation 's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria ."

We do so through a process called structural generalization : we divide the sentence into smaller parts , interpret the meaning of each part , and then put these meanings together to interpret the full sentence . Current language technologies , such as the virtual assistants installed on many mobile phones , are not always able to generate meaning in this way . This leads them to make mistakes when they are expected to understand more complex commands ; these mistakes may be more common in languages that are spoken by smaller communities . The researchers involved in this project will create tests in multiple languages in order to measure a computational system ? s structural generalization capabilities , and will use those tests to teach the system to generalize correctly . This will result in systems that work more reliably and across a wider range of languages . Alongside its technological contribution , this project will help train a new generation of scientists that are well-versed in both artificial intelligence and the structure and diversity of human languages . The project will also draw new populations to the field through outreach events that will introduce students interested in language to artificial intelligence. < br/ > < br/ > From a technical standpoint , the researchers will create both expert-designed and real-world semantic parsing tasks ? mappings from natural language utterances to a formal language that captures their meaning ? which will span a diverse sample of languages . In the expert-designed tasks , natural language inputs will be generated from a grammar created by a linguist , and the outputs will be lambda calculus formulas computed from the input . The distribution of linguistic structures will differ systematically between the training and test set of each task ( ? structural splits ? ) . The structural splits of the expert-designed task will be used to endow artificial neural networks , such as large language models , with an inductive bias that favors structural generalization ; such an inductive bias will then lead to structural generalization on real-world tasks . This will be accomplished using a meta-learning approach , whose objective is to learn from one part of the split and generalize to the other . These behavioral experiments will be accompanied by an investigation of how the network ? s internal properties , such as initial weights , training dynamics and loss landscape , give rise to structural generalization .

From a health perspective , this is a missed opportunity ; dietary self-monitoring is an effective way for people to reflect on and improve their eating habits , reducing the chance of developing costly diet-related chronic diseases such as obesity . This project addresses the weaknesses of existing dietary monitoring methods by advancing a new approach called Interactive Dietary Monitoring . The idea is to envision dietary tracking as a human-machine collaboration , combining the strengths of manual and automated food tracking . For example , people know what food they are eating , but can forget to make a note of it in the moment . Automated systems can detect when people are eating , but have limited insight into the identity of the foods . Thus , a collaborative approach can shore up the complementary weaknesses . To move this vision toward reality , the project team will prototype , evaluate , and refine novel wearable devices , algorithms , and visual interfaces for food tracking , with the goal of reducing the burden of dietary self-monitoring while keeping individuals aware of their eating behaviors . The devices and methods developed are likely to be useful for other pressing problems , including flagging behaviors associated with eating disorders and smoking events , measuring tremor in Parkinson ? s disease patients , and helping nutritional epidemiologists understand the link between diet and disease. < br/ > < br/ > This project will advance the fields of human-computer interaction and ubiquitous computing through ( 1 ) developing and evaluating algorithms to detect fine-grained finger motion and novel interaction techniques around diet tracking , ( 2 ) investigating sensing methods for alcohol drinking detection and food recognition from volatile organic compounds present in human breath , ( 3 ) producing new knowledge about developing wearable devices for dietary tracking , ( 4 ) exploring a new mobile food journal interface that leverages the relationship between color and nutrients to provide visual dietary insights , and ( 5 ) generating usability and algorithmic findings from the inclusion of older adults , seniors with chronic diseases , and under-represented individuals in studies . The outcomes of this proposal will be developed and assessed through a human-centered process consisting of formative studies , implementations , and evaluations in both controlled and naturalistic conditions .

This project ? s goal is to advance research around assessing and designing for trust calibration in visualizations : creating appropriate measures of trust in human-data interaction , building models of how visualization design choices can impact trust , and developing design guidelines for both creators and consumers of visualizations to help them identify signs of trust and mistrust in visualized data . The project team will also create visualization tools , educational materials , and empirical data to help researchers , policymakers , and members of the general public think about trustworthy computing and visualization ethics. < br/ > < br/ > The project is structured around three research objectives . First , referencing theories and research methodologies from social sciences , the project team will produce a collection of methods to reliably measure user trust in data visualizations . Second , using these methods , the team will conduct a systematic series of empirical studies that identify which visualization design factors can drive critical thinking and calibrated trust . These factors will include manipulations of the perceived clarity , complexity , accuracy , and amount of data , using real-world datasets across multiple domains related to public policy and finance . The use of such diverse data will allow the team to identify domain-specific versus generalizable visualization elements that promote critical thinking and calibrated trust . The third objective is a formal evaluation of these guidelines through testing prototype visualizations and visualization systems that facilitate calibrated trust . This will involve field studies and interviews with researchers , practitioners , and members of the general public to examine the effectiveness of the trust guidelines and identify ethical practices for trustworthy visual data communication .

Artificial intelligence ( AI ) can and has already benefited tremendously from exploiting these symmetries . This project seeks to identify and exploit symmetries that are prevalent in cooperative AI tasks , where a group of multiple autonomous sequential decision makers , or agents , plan and learn to maximize their combined benefit . As an example , consider the application of adaptive traffic signal control , where each intersection can be modeled as an agent controlling its traffic signal in a way that adapts to real-time traffic conditions to reduce congestion . There exist certain symmetries when the topology of the road network is regular , e.g. , as a 4-connected grid , and the road condition is uniform .

These computational problems frequently occur when one computes physical systems in large environments . The research aims to exploit geometry to tackle these problems at a fundamental level . A mathematical focus on geometry affords nuanced formulations for fluid dynamics systems that can be more resilient to numerical error . It also offers systematic approaches for identifying the invariants under transformation . Project outcomes are expected to simulate turbulent flows at microscopic scales and remove infinite-domain challenges through suitable transformations , while bringing mathematical ideas in geometry to a larger audience . A diversity-supporting education and outreach plan will likely result in closer communication between different fluid dynamics communities such as computer graphics and the climate sciences. < br/ > < br/ > Many physical simulations take place in a flat Euclidean space . Therefore , a deeper set of geometric tools , usually motivated by non-Euclidean geometry , has yet to draw much attention in developing numerical solvers . This project explores geometric ideas expected to solve fundamental challenges in simulation . One challenge is to simulate fluids at a high Reynolds number , which is central to computer animation , aerodynamics , climate science , etc . The dominating phenomena are intricate vortex dynamics and turbulence often lost during simulation . One thrust of the project aims to develop an implicit flow representation that faithfully encodes the vorticity , in contrast to the traditional formulation using a velocity field . Such an implicit representation can resolve Kolmogorov microscales at low cost . The other thrust , an Erlangen program for simulation , explores transformations of the domains and the variables such that a partial differential equation ( PDE ) is left invariant . When a transformation can turn an infinite domain into a finite domain , finite-domain PDE solvers are automatically infinite-domain PDE solvers after being wrapped by the transformation . This method would fundamentally solve numerical challenges involving infinite domains . Preliminary results suggest that many important PDE systems , including wave equations , signed distance fields , optimal transport problems , and minimal surface problems admit such a hidden symmetry. < br/ > < br/ > This award reflects NSF 's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation 's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria ."

The theoretical underpinning of any computational imaging technique is its model for light propagation . Vision and graphics research generally adopts a geometric optics approximation of light transport , where light travels along straight lines until it undergoes a scattering event or gets absorbed . At small scales , the wave-like properties of light become far more noticeable and require modeling light as a wave at the cost of additional computational overhead . In practice , imaging systems are neither perfectly incoherent ( as in geometric optics ) nor completely coherent ( as in wave optics ) .

Identifying events to describe who did what to whom and their relations ( causal , subevent , and coreferential ) from a large amount of text can provide valuable data to support intelligent applications and data-driven decisions over various domains . However , current event structure extraction systems can only perform over text data for a few popular languages such as English , Chinese , Spanish , and Arabic . Text data from many other languages in the world thus can not be processed by current event extraction systems . This limitation has hindered the coverage of data sources for the systems , introduced language biases in the extracted events , and delayed updates with latest events in local reports .

However , for the vast majority of the world 's 7,000 languages and even more numerous dialects , large scale annotated datasets simply do not exist , preventing speech technology from serving these languages and their speakers . Inspired by the fact that humans learn to speak long before they can read or write , this CAREER project explores a new paradigm for speech processing that does not rely on transcribed speech . Instead , it develops new models that are capable of learning spoken language directly from speech audio , and applies these models to tasks including building speech recognizers without transcribed speech and automatically translating speech from one language into another . These advances fit within a larger movement in the research community to dramatically reduce the cost and increase the availability of speech recognition and understanding technology to many more languages and users than are served today. < br/ > < br/ > This project leverages self-supervised and multimodal learning approaches to automatically discover linguistic structure ( phones , words , phrases , etc . ) in the raw speech signal which can be treated as `` pseudo-text '' and used in place of conventional text for downstream tasks . It develops new neural network layers for attention-based segmentation of speech , applied in a hierarchical fashion to discover speech units at multiple levels of abstraction . A second novel technique involves adding self-prediction layers and training objectives to a model using the segmentation layers , where the higher layers that would capture word-like structure attempt to predict the tokenization of lower layers that capture sub-word structure . In this way , the model can automatically learn a pronunciation lexicon that captures the compositional relationship between the different tiers of discovered speech units .

2317145,Robust Intelligence,Nora Ayanian,CAREER : Crowdsourcing for Multirobot Coordination,1/1/23,"Teams of humans are exceptionally good at coordination . Teams of robots , however , are extremely clumsy at coordination , requiring extensive communication and computation . Reliance on this infrastructure poses a significant roadblock to bringing robot teams into real-world applications . This project is pursuing an integrated research , education , and outreach approach for developing novel , data-driven algorithms for multi-robot coordination , inspired by human coordination . As cognitive beings that make decisions based on broad context , memory , and sensing , human capabilities are challenging to transfer to robotics . To facilitate this transfer , the project is developing an online crowdsourcing application that tasks participants with creating a global structure , such as a shape . The application constrains participants to robot-like capabilities by limiting available information and actions . The application will provide a faithful representation of the capabilities of distributed teams of robots , and will be used to gain insights into human coordination that can then be transferred to a multi-robot system. < br/ > < br/ > The overarching goal of the proposed work is to develop novel methodologies for multi robot coordination firmly grounded in human collaboration , based on models learned from data collected via a crowdsourced online application . To this end , the research objectives are ( 1 ) to explicate the relationship between context ( communication and sensing ) and outcomes in distributed teams of humans working on tightly coupled tasks using data generated from an online multi-person interface ; ( 2 ) to identify , using statistical methods , parameters for distributed teams of robots solving similar shared objective problems ; ( 3 ) to infer , using deep learning architectures , diverse ensembles of coordination models for distributed teams of robots solving tightly coupled problems using the data collected from the crowdsourcing application ; and ( 4 ) to validate these models by evaluating their success in solving tightly coupled problems using a combination of simulation , hardware , and mixed reality experiments ."

This is especially problematic in infectious disease models which leverage available large and inherently biased spatiotemporal data . These biases may propagate through the modeling pipeline to decision-making , resulting in inequitable and ineffective policy interventions . This project investigates how the AI disease modeling pipeline can lead from biased data to biased predictions and to derive solutions that mitigate this bias in three aims : 1 ) creating an AI system to predict the spread of emerging infectious diseases in space and time , 2 ) simulating a population from which we will collect data often used as input for AI systems in a way that the bias is controlled , and 3 ) exploring links between bias in the collected data and the resulting bias in the AI model and deriving solutions for their mitigation .

However , the increasing complexity and the proprietary nature of ML models make it rather challenging for stakeholders to understand the behavior of these models . Consequently , several methods have been proposed in recent years to explain the behavior of ML models in a human-interpretable fashion . These methods , however , adopt vastly different strategies to explain model behavior and often contradict each other . The increasing diversity of these explanation methods , coupled with the lack of systematic evaluation frameworks , have made it impossible to determine which methods are likely to be effective across different kinds of critical real-world applications . This project will build rigorous frameworks for systematically analyzing , evaluating , and comparing the reliability and utility of various state-of-the-art explanation methods across different real-world applications . The frameworks developed as part of this project have the potential to significantly accelerate the adoption of ML models in a variety of settings , including healthcare ( e.g. , patient treatment recommendations ) , lending ( e.g. , loan approval decisions ) , and hiring ( e.g. , resume screening ) . < br/ > < br/ > < br/ > This project aims to systematically characterize existing explanation methods so that practitioners can readily determine which methods to employ in a given real-world application . The project will focus on the following subtasks : 1 ) developing novel theoretical and empirical frameworks to analyze how reliably various state-of-the-art methods explain the behavior of different types of ML models ( e.g. , linear vs. non-linear models ) , 2 ) conducting large-scale user studies with domain experts in healthcare , lending , and hiring to evaluate the utility of existing explanation methods across different high-stakes applications , 3 ) leveraging the data obtained from the aforementioned user studies to build algorithmic agents which can mimic the behavior of domain experts , and employing these agents to , in turn , evaluate the utility of explanation methods at scale , and 4 ) developing novel algorithmic frameworks which can automatically select an appropriate explanation method tailored to a given real-world context . With these contributions , this research will pave the way for a clearer understanding and a broader consensus on which explanation methods are likely to effectively explain the behavior of different ML models across various high-stakes applications. < br/ > < br/ > This award reflects NSF 's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation 's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria ."

Accessing such data is relatively easy ; however , extracting important and meaningful information to get a holistic view from such an overwhelming volume of unstructured , noisy , and redundant data remains extremely challenging . Automatic text summarization models are important computational tools that enable identification of salient pieces of text by condensing several documents into a short , concise summary , with most algorithms focusing on improving the quality of the summaries along dimensions of fluency , factuality , coherence and so on . However , when it comes to summarizing socially diverse data , an important yet overlooked dimension of quality is the breadth of diverse perspectives that a summary encapsulates . This research aims to improve text summarization algorithms for socially rich data and is specifically motivated by applications in natural language processing. < br/ > < br/ > This project will leverage social diversity , a unique characteristic of social data , for improving the overall quality of multi-document summaries .

However , small perturbations invisible to humans can be purposely added to inputs to cause NNs to make incorrect predictions . What is more , attackers can even customize different perturbation strategies to bypass existing NNs ' learning methods and defenses . Thus , one open question is how to make NNs more robust to multiple types of such adversarial perturbations .

Inspired by the powerful immune system , this project aims to infuse key immune system principles into NNs to improve their general robustness , that is , their capability to defend against multiple types of perturbations . The research outcomes will benefit fields that demand robust NNs , such as public health and autonomous driving .

The first aim is to develop an immune-inspired population-point hybrid optimization that can effectively search for robust solutions and maintain the searching efficiency via a self-adversarial mode connectivity strategy . The developed technique will improve existing point-based learning approaches , which easily become trapped in bad local minima . The second aim considers neural network learning from a robust immune consensus perspective that incorporates stochasticity into learning , allowing NNs to capture global feature information . The third aim expands the first two aims by allowing NNs to adapt to unforeseen types of adversarial attacks with an immune-system-inspired lifelong learning regime consisting of a warm start defense strategy and knowledge distillation-based memory model update .

This is up from one-in-11 in 2019 . Thus , older adults are a growing demographic group in society . Because aging is related to increased healthcare utilization , as are pandemics , this increasing demographic translates into the need to increase the workforce in healthcare . The rising demand for healthcare can be combated by deploying activity monitoring systems , which could help monitor the health status of older patients and support the early detection of health issues . Thus , building such monitoring systems requires an automated understanding of Activities of Daily Living ( ADL ) performed by humans . Most of the investigations towards modeling human activities owing to the advances in computer vision are targeted for generic internet videos . Existing models are fabricated for recognition in web videos whereas viewpoint variation and subtle motion that characterize ADLs generally can not handle uncertainty and tend to underperform in real-world scenarios . Moreover , they have difficulties distinguishing similarly looking activities . Thus , the key objective of this project is to build a framework for recognizing ADLs that can be deployed in monitoring systems . The project will also perform complementary educational and outreach activities that engage STEM students. < br/ > < br/ > This project will develop a multi-modal framework predominantly based on the RGB color model and pose modalities due to their easy accessibility in indoor scenarios . This framework aims at addressing two important challenges - the limited availability of labeled ADL videos and how to combine different heterogeneous modalities ( RGB and Poses ) for classifying activities . Thus , this project will explore the integration of two interrelated research directions : ( 1 ) a study on learning from limited training distribution ; and , ( 2 ) a study on combining modalities like RGB and depth . In the first study , the project will explore the possibilities of mitigating the limitation of the scale of available data in the ADL domain for effective training of neural networks for video understanding . In the second study , the team will aim at improving the effectiveness of RGB-based human activity recognition by leveraging the human localized regions within a scene . Finally , we will develop a multi-modal neural network model for ADL by integrating human localized RGB and 3D poses of a human actor .

Even though vision-only UAVs have advantages for system assembly , their automation becomes increasingly difficult when other sensors , such as radars and LiDARs , are not available . This project addresses two fundamental challenges for UAV automation : ( 1 ) how to construct visual perception to have a holistic yet computationally efficient understanding of the surrounding environment using only a vision sensor and ( 2 ) leveraging the established perception system , how to employ visual navigation to perform target-driven , safety-critical operations without relying on maps or GPS . The research of this project is closely integrated with education and outreach activities at the Rochester Institute of Technology. < br/ > < br/ > This research develops technologies for vision-anchored automation of bird-sized UAVs in unknown cluttered indoor environments . The project introduces a method for multi-task fusion to simultaneously detect , segment , and track regions of interest within the video frames . The proposed perception system can achieve a holistic , sensor-fusion-like understanding of the scene using only measurements from the RGB-D camera sensor . The computational tractability of the perception model will be investigated to ensure sufficient operation endurance by leveraging a novel paradigm of recursive knowledge distillation . For navigation tasks , the project includes a novel policy-learning scheme ? empowered by multimodal representations conditioned on observations ? in conjunction with an online domain adaptation technique that could enable bird-sized UAVs to make appropriate decisions in various critical operations , e.g. , target searching and collision avoidance during navigation in a cluttered and confined working space. < br/ > < br/ > This award reflects NSF 's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation 's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria ."
2238960,Robust Intelligence,Christian Kroer,CAREER : Fair and Efficient Market Design at Scale,7/1/23,"Markets are an ancient institution that enables society to efficiently allocate resources by matching supply to demand . Most people think of markets as involving money , for example the stock market . Yet even in problems without money , market design principles play a key role in shaping efficient outcomes . Example problems include medical residency matching , matching students to schools , matching donors to kidneys , fair course seat assignment , housing allocation , and sharing compute resources . Market equilibrium is a key concept in economic theory , specifying how goods , such as course seats or compute resources , can efficiently be distributed among individuals , by finding prices that clear the market . This applies even in settings without money , by giving each individual a budget of faux currency in order to induce a market . Yet , for these ideas to have practical applications , we need methods for computing market equilibria , potentially at large scales . This project will develop an AI and optimization-driven approach to large-scale market equilibrium computation . This will lead to new and fairer algorithms for problems such as matching blood donors to donation sites , course seat allocation , public housing allocation , and fair recommender systems . This project also includes a substantial educational component , including writing a book on modern AI and optimization-based methods for game theory and market design . < br/ > < br/ > The project develops a general AI-driven approach towards operationalizing large-scale market equilibria . This requires the development of new online learning methods that account for real-world structure and machine-learning-based predictions . Concretely , the project makes contributions along the following four technical challenges : 1 ) Online fair allocation and dynamic markets : The project proposes new algorithms for online fair allocation , based on online learning and first-order methods , with a focus on algorithms that are robust to many types of input models , and the extension of recent advances in optimistic and predictive online learning to the fair allocation setting . 2 ) Two-sided preferences : A frequent real-world complication not captured by market-equilibrium-based fair allocation is that both sides of the market correspond to agents that we wish to treat fairly . The project develops a new class of two-sided Fisher market models and algorithms . 3 ) Combinatorial preferences : Combinatorial preferences abound in practice , yet these are not captured by standard models . The project develops new utility classes and associated optimization models and algorithms for handling a wide array of combinatorial utility structures . 4 ) Statistical inference in Fisher markets : The project will initiate the study of statistical inference in Fisher markets , including questions such as the normality of Fisher markets sampled from an underlying model , as well as a new theory of counterfactual inference in markets. < br/ > < br/ > This award reflects NSF 's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation 's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria ."

This CAREER project will use language to bridge this gap by developing techniques that use language-based dataset annotations and large text corpora to guide training of machine learning models for robotics , computer vision , and other problem domains . New approaches for learning with natural language supervision will reduce the amount of data needed to train machine learning models and enable end users to shape model behavior without complex formal specifications . The project will provide research training to undergraduate and graduate students , and will be integrated into a new workshop series that connects academic language processing researchers and researchers in other application areas ( with a focus on providing learning and community-building opportunities for students from historically marginalized groups ) .

When language annotations are available , they can directly supervise the content of these latent representations ; on unannotated examples , information from text corpora may be used to constrain latent representations ' distribution . Language thus plays two roles : as a source of information about the structure of individual training examples and a source of general , task-level background knowledge . Research will yield concrete instantiations of this modeling framework for policy learning , language modeling , and scene understanding , using language to produce structured , composable models that combine the flexibility of the deep learning toolkit with the sample efficiency and controllability of symbolic representations , while requiring neither massive labeled datasets nor precisely formalized symbolic domains. < br/ > < br/ > This award reflects NSF 's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation 's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria ."
2239076,Robust Intelligence,Jun-Yan Zhu,CAREER : Exploiting Deep Generative Models for Visual Recognition,4/1/23,"Modern visual recognition systems have achieved impressive results on standard benchmarks and work reliably for common objects and scenes , given massive data and annotations . Unfortunately , current systems struggle to detect rare or unseen objects and fail to adapt to new domains . Researchers , engineers and/or domain experts have to capture and annotate huge amounts of real data , which are costly for common objects and impractical for rare objects and corner cases ( i.e. , cases that occur when multiple unique conditions simultaneously occur ) . To address the above challenges and automatically create and label data that fully depict the corner cases , this project leverages the rich compositional structure and powerful synthesis capacity of large-scale generative models . By using these models that can quickly synthesize diverse objects and scenes with an unknown visual elements ( e.g. , new poses , weather , lighting , etc. ) . This project will develop recognition algorithms that can recognize rare/unseen objects to adapt to continuously changing environments . This project has a potential to be transformative for various applications , such as autonomous driving , assistive robots , healthcare , e-commerce , and mixed reality . Furthermore , this research will translate to code , models , courses , and tutorials , that are widely accessible to diverse stakeholders and education and research programs that engage with the broader community . < br/ > < br/ > Directly using generative models is challenging , as it is highly unlikely that a randomly sampled image will cover a corner case that can improve recognition systems . To synthesize data that more closely resemble the long-tail distribution and new domains , this project will focus on three research thrusts . First , the project addresses learning visual recognition via generative models by exploring different methods of automatically generating data and annotations . Second , the project will analyze visual recognition systems through generative models by synthesizing diverse , continuously evolving test data to interrogate the system and understand the biases . Finally , the project will automatically select and adapt generative models to new domains and tasks . These three thrusts are tightly connected , as once the algorithms identify hard examples that fail our current system , these examples can be used to close the loop between training and analysis .

2239292,Robust Intelligence,Zsolt Kira,CAREER : Visual Learning in an Open and Continual World,2/1/23,"The field of computer vision has seen significant progress in the past decade : These models are now able to efficiently process complex images and automatically extract information , such as detecting what type of objects exist in the image and where they are located . However , current methods require a pre-specified list of object categories that are in the images . This requirement that is unrealistic when systems are deployed in real-world contexts , such as on self-driving cars or large photo collections . If new types of objects appear , current systems will need to have humans identify the new objects and annotate the images and then retrain the computer vision model through a process that takes significant computational resources . Unlike humans , the system can not automatically understand when new types of objects are in the images , how they relate to objects that the system already knows about , and how to continually update its knowledge given little to no human annotation . This project therefore seeks to enable a computer vision system that can continuously and automatically detect and discover new categories , as well as update its model , with little to no human annotation . Such a capability would have implications in a range of applications , including personalized analysis of photo collections , home robotics , self-driving cars , and medical imaging , where novel unknown objects often lead to misleading or incorrect object detection . The project will address this through a range of research innovations as well as through several outreach activities , including democratizing AI education by working with educators from K-12 and up to teach our open-source course materials . < br/ > < br/ > Towards this end , the goal of this project is to create a framework for an open-world and continual learning system that develops principled methods for naturally understanding and handling different types of distribution shifts , as well as incrementally discovering and learning new categories as they appear in unlabeled data , and placing them within a rich semantic hierarchical structure . This will be accomplished by first detecting different types of distribution shift that can occur ( e.g. , changes in appearance due to weather or existence of entirely new objects ) and developing principled out-of-distribution detection and calibration methods to disentangle them . These methods will be used to understand how they affect the model 's predictions . Subsequently , rather than just detecting whether new categories exist and throwing the resulting data out , this fine-grained understanding of distribution shift will support incrementally updating the model in response . This will be done by developing methods to build long-term representations and classifiers that discover new categories and place them within a rich hierarchical semantic structure . Finally , semi-supervised continual learning will be leveraged to incrementally refine the representations and automatically learn classification and detection models , using a mixture of labeled and unlabeled data appearing at different times , while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. < br/ > < br/ > This award reflects NSF 's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation 's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria ."
2246221,Robust Intelligence,Stas Tiomkin,CRII : RI : Interpretable Framework and Transformative Applications for Viability in Autonomous Agents,4/1/23,"This project advances the knowledge in robot intelligence via research on ? viability ? of robots . Viability is the ability of a system to autonomously maintain itself or recover functionality after an adverse critical event and is a desired feature of robust intelligence and autonomy . An example of a critical event is a robot landing upside down and being unable to stand up without an external assistance . Other examples are an unmanned underwater vehicle in an unrecoverable state , a robotic arm getting stuck in clutter , or a car with poor braking performance due to a mechanical failure . The principal objective of this project is to develop a framework for the design of viable ( self-recoverable ) artificial agents . The main challenge is to formulate a metric for viability that can be calculated for various scenarios . This metric needs to be computable from the motor and sensor readings . The first task of this project is to develop an effective metric for agent viability from the essential properties of control systems , along with computationally efficient methods for its calculation . The second task is to demonstrate the applicability of this framework for useful problems in ( i ) self-recovery of walking robots and ( ii ) self-maintenance of car brakes . This project not only advances the understanding of robot viability , but also proposes new machine-learning approaches for control and analysis of dynamical systems. < br/ > < br/ > To achieve its goals , this project will extend the classical notion of Lyapunov exponents towards ? Agent-Induced Lyapunov Exponents ? , AILE , which prioritize states with diverse potentialities , and with a large space of effectively controllable states . AILE allows artificial agents to train autonomously , maintaining themselves or recovering capabilities without the need for problem-specific externally provided reward functions . Computational methods will be developed for the calculation of the AILE metric with known and unknown dynamics , and with partially and fully observable state . This capacity will allow for the broad applicability of the framework . It will be demonstrated in two transformative applications : self-recovery of locomotion agents , and control of chaotic ? stick-slip ? friction in car brakes . This project is not framed along the lines of traditional disciplinary boundaries , but rather bridges between machine learning , dynamical systems , mechanics , and information theory . This project will open doors to new research directions and technology for fully-autonomous agents with an enormous potential for replacing and/or assisting humans in risky situations , such as driving. < br/ > < br/ > This award reflects NSF 's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation 's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria ."

2239363,Robust Intelligence,Karthik Narasimhan,CAREER : Reading To Learn : Language-Guided Machine Learning,1/15/23,"Humans have used language for centuries in order to communicate with each other and pass knowledge to successive generations . We learn through a combination of 'doing ' things to receive feedback from the world ( e.g . feeling pain when we put our finger in the fire ) as well as 'reading ' about how the world works ( e.g . Wikipedia might say 'Fire has the potential to cause pain and physical damage through burning ' ) . Modern artificial intelligence ( AI ) systems learn new skills predominantly through the former method , using a trial-and-error mechanism that requires comparing their own predictions against human-specified answers or judgements . While this approach has worked for automating a variety of tasks , it requires a large amount of data and computational resources , and is limited to task domains where trial-and-error learning is appropriate due to the low stakes involved . This project will develop techniques for a new paradigm of language-guided machine learning that will enable AI systems to acquire new knowledge and skills by reading relevant text in natural language such as books , manuals and webpages . This will result in robust AI models that require less human effort to train while allowing for better user personalization . < br/ > < br/ > Current approaches to efficient machine learning such as domain adaptation , few-shot learning , continual learning and reinforcement learning can only operate over task-specific symbolic or mathematical representations pre-specified by model developers ( such as class IDs or hierarchies , dynamics models , reward functions ) and do not leverage linguistic knowledge providing the same information . This CAREER project will develop models that can ? read ? to acquire knowledge from textual sources and incorporate it into a better learning process for different paradigms . This includes supervised classification tasks as well as sequential decision-making where an agent executes several actions in an interactive environment . Models that can automatically acquire new knowledge and skills by reading text ( from books , webpages , or human feedback ) will require smaller amounts of traditional supervision , generalize better to unseen scenarios , and substantially reduce human effort in model development . The project will achieve this goal by tackling three key directions : ( 1 ) enabling language-guided supervised learning by developing a new framework for providing semantic class descriptions , ( 2 ) improving efficiency and generalization to new domains in reinforcement learning by leveraging offline textual guidance , and ( 3 ) enabling online adaptation of policies using linguistic feedback through human-machine collaboration .
