8902125,ARTIFICIAL INTELL & COGNIT SCI,Fred Roberts,Limitations on Problem Solving Imposed by Measurements,8/15/89,"In solving decisionmaking problems , both human and artificial decisionmakers use scales of measurement based on subject judgements to choose among alternative courses of action or to select optimal strategies . With this in mind , the investigator is attempting to understand in a systematic way the limitations that properties of scales of measurement place on the conclusions one may meaningfully draw using such scales . He is studying such limitations for conclusions from the solutions to problems of optimization , from averaging or merging techniques to combine individual judgements , from relative scores used to choose among alternative technologies or alternative heuristics , and from models used for solving practical problems involving resources allocation , communications , transportation , technology assessment , etc . An important aspect of the work concerns the implications of these limitations for the use of scales of measurement in problem solving by human or artificial problem solvers . The investigator will attempt to develop the theory of meaningful statements and to study various theoretical questions about the theory of scales of measurement which underly its use in the analysis of practical decisionmaking problems ."
8715623,INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE,William Thompson,Knowledge-Based Justification,7/1/88,"An expert system is designed to solve hard problems usually requiring considerable expertise . Users are more likely to accept such a system if they can ask for and receive explanations of the system 's conclusion . Our contention is that improved explanations can be generated by a knowledge-based explanation system ( loosely coupled to the expert system ) that actively searches for support of the expert system 's conclusion . Current methods of explanation derive their informtion almost entirely from a trace of the rules used during the expert system 's problem-solving process . Additional information , when present at all , is introduced through justifications of these rules . We propose to build a system that treats the generation of explanations as a problem-solving activity largely distinct from the processes initially used to solve a problem . This system will move expert system explanation from a passive ( unintelligent ) task of presenting rule traces to an active ( intelligent ) task of searching for explanations in support of the conclusion of the problem-solving expert system . At the center of our knowledge-based explanation techniques ( the knowledge of how to explain ) . This knowledge will influence not only the way information is presented to the user , but also what information is presented tothe user . With this ability to determine both the content and form of the explanation , our system will have increased flexibility over previous explanation systems . This increased flexibility will be used to support the creation of explanations that more naturally support the expert system 's conclusion ."
8718975,ROBOTICS,Drew McDermott,Theory of Learning Algorithms,5/15/88,"This research deals with the theoretical investigation of learning algorithms that use examples and additional information from a teacher . It is motivated by the problem of knowledge acquisition in expert systems . The additional information considered includes queries to the teacher and training sequences devised by the teacher , that is , examples of similar or related phenomena intended to guide and simplify the learning process . The extension of the `` probably approximately correct '' concept to learning from positive-only examples , and the study of its relation to pseudo-random number generators are also proposed ."
8710836,"ROBOTICS, CROSS-DIRECTORATE PROGRAMS",Viktor Prasanna,Parallel Processing of Computer Vision Problems ( Computer and Information Science ),6/1/87,"Parallel Processing has been widely used in image processing . A number of parallel architectures such as cellular arrays , memory augmented arrays , and pyramids have been proposed for these tasks . In the past , many problems in low- and medium- level vision have been solved on these architectures . This research will explore parallel architectures for a range of problems in computer vision and develop efficient parallel algorithms for them . As part of the research , several novel VLSI arrays including arrays with efficient global communication features , arrays with reduced processing requirements , as well as reconfigurable VLSI arrays will be developed . While these architectures are also suitable for many other problems , they seem to be particularly well-suited for vision applications due to inherent properties of problems in low-level vision . This research will also investigate parallel algorithms for medium-and high-level vision problems . Finally , the use of information theoretic techniques to study the interprocessor communication requirements and inherent parallel complexity of solving several fundamental problems in vision will be investigated ."

8907890,ARTIFICIAL INTELL & COGNIT SCI,Dana Nau,Efficient Hierarchial Planning,9/1/89,"Efficient hierarchical planning , based on a task network , is the topic of this research . Goal and subgoal interactions will be investigated to achieve improved control strategies for planning . For example , it should be possible to improve both the quality of the plan and the efficiency of the planning process by developing a control strategy which selects among alternative task reductions in such a way as to avoid harmful interactions while encouraging helpful interactions . The following specific issues are central to this investigation : ( 1 ) how the various properties of interactions can guide the choice among alternative reductions in a task network ; ( 2 ) how to improve the consistency of task network representations , in particular , how to identify situations where a seemingly unresolvable conflict can be resolved at a lower level in the task network ; ( 3 ) how to take advantage of the fact that some planning tasks , while not independent in general , become independent once certain other plannng decisions have been made . The investigators anticipate that completion of the above research topics will result in significantly improved planning in a number of environments . To test this idea , they will implement a planning system incorporating the above ideas , and evaluate its performance on a number of domains ."
8719889,DIGITAL SOCIETY&TECHNOLOGIES,Jan Acton,PLANNING GRANT FOR THE ANALYSIS OF DEMAND AND PRICING OF COMPUTER SERVICES ( Computer and Information Science ),9/1/87,"This research is to undertake a preliminary examination of the growing use of NSF sponsored supercomputers and computers that may substitute for some or all of their functions . The goal is to develop a research plan leading to a better understanding of the determinants of demand for large-scale computing services and better pricing structures to make the most efficient use of the services and their alternatives . The researchers will review the extant literature on demand and pricing of computer services , develop a conceptual model of demand for supercomputing services , will develop pricing models appropriate to the use of supercomputing services , meet with knowledgeable individuals , and develop a full research plan . NSF has an interest in the pricing and demand for computers for several reasons . First , NSF supports university-based supercomputer centers . There soon may be demands for more computer time than these centers can supply and some price or non-price rationing scheme will be needed . Second , supercomputers may involve transferring large volumes of input or output between remote users and a central computer , so network congestion and usage charges may be significant . Third , NSF grants often include an element for computer usage ; so NSF has an added interest in efficient and equitable pricing policies for all types of computer services ."

8813371,DIGITAL SOCIETY&TECHNOLOGIES,James Jordan,Information Processing in Interactive Organizations,8/15/88,"Most economic theories specify equilibrium relationships among economic variables , and , at least implicitly , the equilibrium information flows among economic decision-makers . However , the adjustment process which moves the system to an equilibrium position is usually not specified . This research proposes a method for analyzing a general class of such adjustment processes . The principal goal of this analysis is to determine the minimal communication and coordination among economic decision-makers needed to achieve equilibrium . This can be compared with the information flow generated by the economic institutions under study . If the latter is less than the former , equilibrium can not generally be achieved , and the equilibrium relationships can not reliably approximate actual economic behavior . This information analysis is proposed as a new source of discipline in the evaluation of economic models . When the convergence to equilibrium requires information which can not easily be communicated in an ongoing fashion , two directions of research are suggested . First , the additional information might be inferred from the historical behavior of observable variables , and this information might then be used in the design of the adjustment process . Second , the equilibrium concept might be changed to embody more modest optimality criteria . The latter approach is proposed specifically for the theory of the firm when communication is limited to accounting information ."
8704614,INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE,Tomasz Imielinski,Complexity Tailored Information Systems ( Computer and Information Science ),12/1/87,"This research explores a fundamental revision of the concept of deductive databases . The new approach , Complexity Tailored Information Systems , 1 ) allows a variety of possible answers to any given query , 2 ) produces answers determined both by the query and by the computational resources of the system , and 3 ) uses meaningful approximations to the precise answers , when determination of a precise answer would be impossible because of lack of time or computational resources . The significance of this research is that database systems will increasingly be required to function in real-time and draw on large knowledge resources to solve complex queries . Effective alternatives to exhaustive search and deduction will be vital ."
8722576,ROBOTICS,William Thompson,Moving Object Detection,7/15/88,"The detection of moving objects in the environment is important for a broad range of tasks involving activities such as locomotion , manipulation , and description . This proposal describes a line of research aimed at studying vision-based techniques for recognizing the presence of moving objects in the field of view . The solutions must have broad generality and good reliability ; the analysis specifically deals with problems associated with moving-object detection when the camera may also be moving . In the latter case , moving and stationary objects may both be changing position with respect to the camera , generating visual motion in the imagery . Significant preliminary work has been completed on the problem . The proposed work would build on the prior results by addressing three problems that are central to the development of a general understanding of detection of moving objects : ( 1 ) how can depth information be combined with visual motion ? ( 2 ) can existing structure-from-motion algorithms be extended to include the detection of motion while avoiding problems with numerical instability ? ( 3 ) can detectability thresholds be computed based on magnitudes of relative motion and noise , and how do various simplifying assumptions affect those thresholds ?"

The robot arms considered here are assumed to have a contact-sensitive sensory skin such as nearly all animals possess . ( Such arms are being developed in a parallel project at Yale . ) Prior studies of the two-dimensional case produced fast algorithms guaranteed to converge to a global position goal . This work will extend the simulation and mathematical analyses to three-dimensional arms of increasing complexity .

8812790,ROBOTICS,Drew McDermott,Spatial and Temporal Reasoning about Machines,2/15/89,"The objective of this project is to develop an algorithm for deriving concise behavioral descriptions of machine behavior from machine structure . Past work has led to a simulator that can analyze a wide variety of mechanisms kinematically , and simulate many of them to see what they will do . The simulator will be generalized , and used to run a loop analyzer that posits and tests regularities in behavior in order to produce hypotheses about what the mechanism will do indefinitely far into the future ."
8702600,"ROBOTICS, CROSS-DIRECTORATE PROGRAMS",Michael Conrad,Evolutionary Programming and Neural Computation ( Computer and Information Science ),6/15/87,"The goal of evolutionary programming is to develop systems which learn how to perform critical computing tasks through a variation and selection algorithm . The appproach taken in this research is based on the recognition that some structural organizations are well-suited to learning through evolution , while others are not . A system that achieves evolvability by simulating the structure-fashion relations that facilitate evolution in biological systems has been developed . Currently the system consists of simulated networks of dynamic neurons whose input-output behavior is controlled by membrane proteins . The variation and selection learning algorithm acts on the distribution of proteins . The organization is well-suited to evolution because improvement can always be achieved through single , reasonably likely application of the variation operator . The continuous dynamics displayed by the neurons also enhances the generalization capability of the system . The system is called a molecular design since it was inspired by biophysical and biochemical properties of neurons . However , the new efforts will be concerned with virtual implementations that would be useful in and of themselves and which could provide some insight into natural information processing . Specific objectives are : to incorporate richer nonlinear and cell automation dynamics , to add a memory manipulation capability , to implement the system as a preprocessor for high-level vision and process control tasks , and to create systems capable of long-term evolutionary improvement by applying the variation and selection operators to the dynamics ."

Highly interactive ( hypertext ) systems for brows- ing databases can promote natural , low-cognitive load search strategies . Still lacking , however , is a scientific basis for designing user-oriented organizations of data or user-oriented views of database content . This research seeks to test aspects of a theory of information seeking which can explain users ' interactions with machines to find information . In particular , through experimental analysis of such interactions it examines users ' development and application of mental models of hypertext systems employed for that purpose . The research will contribute to an emerging theory of information seeking in electronic environments , guide designers of adaptive information systems , and facilitate the development of methods and materials for human information seeking ."

The major emphasis is in the area of inductive inference , the capabilities and limitations of computers to learn by example . Several problems dealing with multiple machine inference , probabilistic inference , and the complexity of inference will be studied . The problem of inductive inference is related to the problem of program testing . The continued exportation of ideas and techniques from the field of inductive inference to applications concerning the testing of programs will be a main focus of this research . Other problems under study include foundational issues concerning data flow architectures and implementations of applicative programming languages . Issues and problems concerning abstract complexity theory have come out of the preliminary work of a previous NSF project . The fundamental problem addressed in this research is to classify and otherwise delimit the space of complexity measures that apply to a given programming system ."

This award is designed to result in a fully developed proposal to be submitted to the NSF at the end of the Planning Grant period . The implementation of computerized information technologies poses major challenges to organizations . Although offering substantial long-term benefits , the implementation of these technologies may alter familiar production processes and threaten established organizational hierarchies , power bases , social norms , communication patterns , job characteristics , and career paths . An organization 's ability to manage these challenges may determine the ultimate outcomes of technology implementation : ( 1 ) the extent to which the new technology is used ; ( 2 ) the gains in organizational performance attributable to the new technology ; and ( 3 ) the level of employee satisfaction with the new technology and with the organization as a whole . The proposed research is designed to assess the organizational determinants of these outcomes . The research develops a model of implementation problems and determinants of successful outcomes , develops a cross-sectional survey research design and develops appropriate measures for the model 's variables ."
8958546,INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE,Christos Faloutsos,Presidential Young Investigator Award,8/1/89,"This project is concerned with three areas of database research ; geometric data , text and multimedia filing sytems and multiple disk file allocations . In search of the best method to manage geometric data , several promising methods will be analyzed and implemented for comparison . Emphasis will be given to space filling curves and fractals , such as the Peano curve , the Hilbert curve , curves based on Gray codes , because they lead to good distance preserving mappings . The second project involves the development of a multimedia document filing system . The novel characteristics of the system is that it will use signature files for text retrieval , it will use optical disks for storage and it will allow static and animated images in the documents . Declustering techniques that store a file on multiple disks to maximize the parallellism will be studied . This goal is the inverse of the first project . The problem is to group unsimilar records on the same disk . A heuristic that uses information theory and error correcting codes , because the codewords of such codes are deliberately unsimilar has been developed . Preliminary experiments show that this heuristic consistently outperforms older ad hoc heuristics ."

The significance of this work is that the explosively growing number of documents available to scientists , engineers , and researchers in all fields can now only be handled effectively by computer systems . Current indexing systems operate rapidly , but must be improved to accurately retrieve the most relevant documents while retrieving very few irrelevant documents for any given query ."

It utilizes a new method , called signature files , which works well for archival applications with very active updating . The method is especially suitable for optical disks . Specifically , signature files are compared with other indexing methods analytically and through simulation . Several alternative signature extraction methods are implemented and evaluated to verify analytical results , and integrated signature methods , which cover both the text itself and `` keyword '' attributes , are developed . To perform realistic experiments , a prototype retrieval system is used , which stores and retrieves abstracts of technical articles . This prototype is available to researchers at the University of Maryland , to assist them with literature searching and to give feedback to the system designers about what capabilities are needed and how the system is used . There is an enormous and increasing amount of scientific knowledge captured in the form of published articles and reports . This `` text database '' is far too large to be effectively used without computer assistance . Consequently , research on automatic retrieval methods , which allow effective and extensive searching to be done with computer systems , is of paramount scientific and practical importance ."
8802419,ROBOTICS,Laveen Kanal,Neural Network Architectures for the Direct Perception of 3D Motion and Depth,10/15/88,"A massively parallel approach to the tracking of rigid motions in image sequences can be based on a Lie-algebra formalism . This research will extend the theoretical basis of such neural-network visual analysis , with experimental verification via a Connection Machine simulation . The key insight is that instantaneous tracking of variations in Gibson 's `` flow of the optic array '' can be achieved by local wiring of Hoffman orbits derived from a canonical Lie decomposition . This is similar to repeated application of a Hough transform , but will here be combined with a new technique for exploiting `` momentum '' of the visual flow . Inspiration for this work comes from Pitts and McCulloch 's theory on the extraction of universals from transformation groups . The goal is to track objects simultaneously in position and depth , without first segmenting them from the optic field ."
8719458,INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE,Nicholas Roussopoulos,High Performance Engineering Information Systems,6/1/88,"We propose to develop High Performance Engineering Information System ( EIS ) based on Incremental Computation Models . These models utilize results of previous computations stored in persistent cache structures by merging them with new results obtained from computations performed on the incremental changes of the database . Because computation is performed on small increments rather than the whole database , incremental computation models achieve performances that are far beyond the reach of ordinary models . High performance EISs will be able to support engineering knowledge bases of significant size , explicit models of interdependent knowledge , optimization techniques for deductive queries , and efficient methods for organizing and accessing large numbers of engineering facts and rules . The persistent cache structures of the incremental models provide an innovative self-improving performance capability for computation intensive EICs ."
8802940,INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE,Timoleon Sellis,Multiple-Query Processing and Caching in Deductive Database Systems,9/1/88,"The implementation and performance of intelligent support mechanisms for query processing and optimization in deductive databases will be investigated . First , the efficient evaluation of multiply-defined rules will be examined . The evaluation of such rules results in the processing of more than one relational query . In contrast to the traditional single command-at-a-time optimization multiple-query optimization techniques can reduce the cost of processing a set of queries through sharing of common execution paths . The second major target is the idea of storing results of previously processed rules in secondary storage ( caching ) . Using a cache , the cost of processing a query can be reduced by preventing multiple evaluations of the same rules . Various techniques for implementing efficient caching mechanisms , including replacement policies and validation schemes will be evaluated . Addressing the above issues successfully will improve the ability of future deductive database systems to support non- traditional application areas , like engineering environments and artificial intelligence , which require the use of advanced control mechanisms such as rules ."

It is proposed to find solutions to spatial problems that make use of hierarchical data structures ; hierarchical solutions to path planning and polygon expansion will be attempted . The concept of neighbor-finding will be generalized , and the use of the active- border paradigm in octree construction will be explored . The surface spatial data type will be investigated . We will examine the question of whether spatial queries can be processed inteligently by the construction of an expert system interface that uses the representation of the spatial elements to which the query refers . Theoretical investigation of Delaunay triangulations will be continued .

Parallel architectures for database processing need to incorporate both parallel processors ( CPU 's ) and parallel I/O ( disk access ) capability . This research is focused on a boolean n-cube connected architecture , with a disk attached to each node , thereby providing parallel I/O . The need to support parallel I/O gives rise to two important issues : data combination and non-uniform data distribution . Since the cube interconnection subsumes many other structures such as trees , rings , etc. , this property is exploited to efficiently support data combination in a variety of database operations such as Selection , Aggregation , Join , and Projection . The research involves both analytic and simulation study of various database operations under a variety of initial and intermediate data distribution conditions , using a 64-node hypercucbe . Modern fabrication techniques make it possible to produce hundreds or even thousands of computing elements ( processors ) at low cost . The significance of this research is that parallel processing algorithms are critical to harnessing the fabrication potential to produce real benefit for applications such as database processing .

The system is computationally parallel since all classifiers may be applied to all messages simultaneously . Classifier systems discover by means of a genetic algorithm which creates promising new classifiers from successful ones . This genetic procedure conducts a parallel search for the building blocks of problem solutions . Classifier systems already exhibit successful learning and discovery , including the emergence and stability of both multilevel default hierarchies and chains of classifiers relevant to means of software packages developed for expressing problematic environments and for formulating classifier programs . The project will study the different roles of strength ( wealth ) , the roles of generality and specificity in hierarchies and classifier reproduction , and the emergence of building blocks . Adaptive systems which develop their own goals will also be covered . Our computer experiments are guided by a theory of adaptation . The fundamental theorem characterizes the rate at which the genetic algorithm samples the building blocks of useful models of the environment . We will extend this theorem to cover the discovery of regularities in rapidly changing environments ."

Scientists from the University of Michigan will cooperate with colleagues from the Software Technology Program at Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation ( MCC ) and Arthur Andersen & Co . The specific projects represent the blending of skills in the building of computer systems , the empirical analysis of human behavior , and the application of theory , both from technology and from cognitive science , to the design and analysis of technology augmentations of work . The approach stresses the need to use a vision of future technology environments to navigate the design space of collaborative technology , but uses the science base of behavioral science on the one hand and computer science and information systems on the other to assist in the development of technology experiments . The research will pursue the following specific activities : Studies of current practice -- 1 . An analysis of collaboration from interview data already collected by MCC 2 . Observational studies of collaboration as they occur now ; Studies of groupware supported collaboration -- 3 . Studies of collaboration using MCC groupware prototypes 4 . Studies of collaboration using University of Michigan groupware prototypes . The project will use observational methods to study group behavior in situ , and will use successive generations of groupware prototypes as experimental tools for better understanding the collaborative process itself .

All these features can be elegantly expressed within the framework of high order logic . The current logic programming and deductive database paradigm will be naturally extended to higher order logic by employing many sorted first order proof theory . The resulting data model should be efficiently implementable . Uniform treatment of data and logic program by the structuring and typing facilities will support the development of an expressive logic based database programming language , suitable for a broad range of applications ."

In addition , such a design process is helped by an understanding of methods for controlling search in the construction of solutions which combine uncertain evidence from multiple plausible interpretations . One strategy for adding to the available methods for scene understaning is to build successive systems for interpretation in increasingly difficult domains . This research , focuses on a domain that demands capabilities which exceed those of the current techniques . The project is aimed at developing a system for the automatic interpretation of tissue section images of hair cells of the organ of Corti in the inner ear . This domain is complex enough to engender the development of new techniques and tractable enough for study . Domain knowledge is available in the form of expectations for location , orientation , and geometric relations of objects , and in the form of expert protocol for interpretation . Because of the nature of the images , interpretation based only on local features is impractical , providing the opportunity to investigate methods for combining uncertain evidence from several sources under the guidance of domain knowledge . Further , interpretation requires the use of images from several focal planes , giving us the opportunity to investigate symbolic feedback in a combination of both data- driven and knowledge-controlled interpretation methods . Finally , results from human interpretation of slides provide clear standards for evalutiion of the system ."

In particular , we propose the following research tasks : Knowledge Management : In our research , we propose the necessary constructs to describe our knowledge ( meta-knowledge ) about the system-level objects such as integrity constraints , deductive laws , classes , methods , and transactions . We also propose to employ the meta-level knowledge to ensure the quality of knowledge in a dynamic environment where knowledge is updated frequently and to facilitate to control of knowledge bases .

The transformation system employs rewriting rules to substitute pieces of a query with some semantically equivalent sub-queries that can be solved more efficiently . Subsequently , the conjuncts in the transformed query are reorderd dynamically to minimize the evaluation cost .

The study employs a taxonomy that divides standard setting into classes based on ( a ) the extent to which there are strong interests in promoting the adoption of any universal standard and ( b ) whether there are vested interests in the adoption of a particular standard . This gives rise to a classification in which the possible outcomes are Pure Coordination ( where voluntary standards emerge because there is strong interest in adopting a standard and few vested interests ) , Pure Public Goods ( where there are few vested interests but small interest in promoting a standard , so that government intervention may be required ) , Pure Private Goods ( where no agent wants standardization because there are few private benefits and large vested interests ) , and Conflict ( where each agent wants its preferred technology to be the standard ) . The taxonomy is used to guide case studies that include those involving standards for Open Network Architectures , European telephone systems , data base software , the Unix computer operating system , and electronic mail . The study identifies those factors that determine whether these cases involve Pure Coordination , Pure Public Goods , Pure Private Goods , or Conflict and why different agents may prefer different outcomes .

About eight work groups of 15.20 people in two or more organizations are studied over eight months as they use electronic mail . Half the groups have a range of modification options ; the others operate with unmodifiable systems . Effects at individual and group levels are studied using a combination of system.logged indicators , behavioral methods , and self reports . Analysis focuses on short and long.range performance effects , structural and communication effects , and the tradeoffs observed among outcomes .

The allocation of resources to systems agents , and the control of feedback loops between different levels of interpretation of the time-varying signal are approached with strategies that simulate real-time problem solving . At the lowest level of analysis , multi-rate signal processing , used in conjection with focus-switching heuristics , ought to yield high resolution simultaneously in time and frequency , thus giving an efficient method for improving upon traditional bandwidth-time tradeoffs . Source coherence criteria derived from psychoacoustic work on auditory streaming ( including correlated AM and FM modulation among partials ) are expected to be useful for separating sources when more familiar methods do not suffice . The proposed system relies on a learning co-processor to attune itself to increasingly elusive aspects of a signal .

8822346,DIGITAL SOCIETY&TECHNOLOGIES,William O'Neill,A Study of Future Markets and Stock Price Volatility Using Shannon 's Separation Theorem,6/1/89,"Information relevant to market transactions is usually generated exogenously and at random times . A given sample of these market `` fundamentals '' must be reliably transmitted to prices before the next sample occurs if the market is to be efficient . Markets clear sequentially at a frequency which is typically far in excess of the average frequency of fundamentals . This time-base relation between fundamentals and market clearing prices is shared by communications channels which transmit individual information source samples using multiple transmissions on the channel . But the market-channel analog is incomplete because market agents are motivated by profits while channel users pursue reliable communication . This proposal suggests these sometimes conflicting goals can be resolved . The embodiment of the suggestion is a demonstration that a popular futures market model is identical to a model of bandwidth expansion over a channel with noiseless feedback when market agents tradeoff profits against reliable communication . Empirical tests of this tradeoff are proposed for a grain futures market . The demonstration also suggests that sequential auction models act as estimators of information sources and therefore are relevant to the controversy surrounding price volatility in stock valuation models . The research estimates information rates for recognized stock market fundamentals and establishes volatility standards by comparing source information rates with the stock valuation model capacity . The market models considered assume source information is generated in randomly timed bursts . Consequently , the multiple- trader futures model is a study in multiple-access channel source coding . In an efficient market with optimal profit-taking and information transfer , both testable hypotheses , agent trading behavior should solve a multiple-access coding problem . Tat solutions of pen problems in market theory can contribute to open problems in communication theory is further evidenced by showing that the determination of the proportion of informed market participants solves a challenging problem of finding the capacity of an arbitrarily varying channel . The significance of the study lies in the recognition that there are no known tests yielding a standard measure of the ultimate reliability with which market prices can reflect fundamental information . Successful empirical studies will establish such a standard . In addition , treating markets as a symbiont of communication theory offers the prospect that actual markets can serve as experimental resources for solving significant problems in communication theory ."

This project will employ a normative-descriptive approach to systematically investigate team performance in such contexts . The fundamental tenet of the normative-descriptive theory is that motivated expert decision makers strive for optimality , but are constrained from achieving it by their inherent limitations and cognitive biases . The normative-descriptive theory employs normative solutions as a baseline , and modifies these solutions by placing psychologically interpretable constraints and structure on the team 's cognitive processes to provide accurate predictions of team performance . These models , which are experimentally validated , provide a relevant basis for designing distributed database and communication subsystems that best support the needs of human decision makers . The working hypothesis put forward in this project is that human teams adapt their coordination strategies to workload demands . At low workload teams prefer to coordinate explicitly using communication channels . Under moderate workload teams rely on implicit coordination , exercising internal models to anticipate the needs of other team members . Under high workload off-line pre-planning replaces on-line coordination . This project will investigate , using the normative-descriptive approach , explicit and implicit coordination in the areas of team information processing , resource allocation , and task sequencing . The research on information coordination characterizes the amount of communication needed among team members for superior explicit coordination , and the role of feedback as a means of improving implicit coordination . The research on resource and task coordination focuses on when a leader is necessary to improve coordination , and on how coordination strategies change when different mixes of sequential , parallel , and multiple actions must be taken by the team .

8816078,INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE,Stanley Williamson,Behaviour and Structure in Databases,6/1/89,"Traditionally , relational databases have emphasized static aspects of data . For instance , data modeling has been done using just static constraints , and data manipulation has emphasized queries over updates . This was due in part to the nature of early database applications , which were mostly business oriented . Consequently , the relational model has not reflected semantics relating to data behaviour . This feature has been widely regarded as a drawback of the relational model , particularly at a time when new applications have led to increased emphasis in conceptual modeling on behavioural aspects of data . However , many basic aspects concerning data behaviour and its connection with structure are not well understood . The primary focus of the present proposal is the study of update languages and specification methods for behaviour . A variety of update languages are studied and their expressive power characterized . One tractable update language of special practical importance , called domain-based , is studied in detail with respect to optimization , parallelization , and concurrency control . The other languages range over a spectrum of procedural and declarative update languages . Next to update languages and specification methods for behaviour , of special concern is the connection between behaviour ( expressed by valid updates or dynamic constraints ) and structure ( specified in relational databases by static constraints ) . This will be investigated under the present proposal subject to time and resource availability . It is expected that this research will lead to better database design methodologies integrating structural and behavioural aspects , better means for checking the soundness of a specification , and a more efficient approach to database integrity . Some of the results will be relevant to adjacent areas , such as Programming Languages and Artificial Intelligence ."

To date , most of the studies deal with these two problems sequentially . The paradigm of conventional methods is a three-step model in which motion analysis ( e.g. , estimation of motion parameters and surface structure ) rely on the result of the correspondence problem but not vice versa . One is therefore forced to resolve correspondence based on the properties of featured elements in successive image frames , but not on their geometric considerations which might allow a motion interpretation . If these two problems are treated on the same level simultaneously , then several advantages for understanding time-varying imagery could emerge . This research builds on previous work using this approach .

In the past , artificial intelligence researchers have often avoided probability theory for reasoning with uncertainty because of a common perception that the application of probability theory is invariably associated with a commitment to intractable algorithms and inordinate knowledge-acquisition time . The development of efficient algorithmic and assessment techniques would allow investigators to apply a theoretically justified model of belief entailment to complex problems . As a result , the goals in this research are ( 1 ) to develop techniques for using knowledge about problem-solving tradeoffs to optimize dynamically the value of computer performance to the user , ( 2 ) to construct efficient algorithms for probabilistic reasoning , and ( 3 ) to investigate pragmatic techniques for the elicitation of knowledge from experts . Two existing diagnostic systems are testbeds for this research , which is directly applicable to many areas of science and engineering . Although the techniques of artificial intelligence are being used to provide decision support tools ( `` expert systems '' ) in a variety of settings within science , technology , and industry , several fundamental research problems remain . One significant concern is the lack of well-developed methods for dealing with the uncertainty that characterizes many problem-solving tasks . For example , in medicine or geological exploration , experts must infer the state of the process they are investigating ( e.g. , a patient 's disease or a possible mineral deposit ) by interpreting indirect measurements that generally provide only partial support for hypotheses . Most available tools deal with such uncertainty by using ad hoc methods whose applicability and limitations are poorly understood . By developing practical methods for using formal probability theory in such systems , this research replaces ad hoc techniques with approaches for which the underlying assumptions and limitations can be demonstrated analytically and considered during system construction and use ."

The research concerns the design of efficient organizational schemes . In particular , it considers the comparative advantages of hierarchical arrangements . The authors posit a group of agents who are to take actions in a changing environment . The joint action has to meet a performance standard , i.e. , it has to lie in a set that depends on the environment . Each member observes some component of the actual environment and chooses her action after receiving messages from others . A network mechanism prescribes messages sent and actions taken and may be hierarchical . A network mechanism is efficient if it satisfies the performance standard and no other mechanism does so at a smaller informational cost . Cost is measured by the size of the set of messages that agents can send or receive . General techniques for constructing efficient mechanisms have been applied to a multi-plant firm example and an exchange-economy example . The broader significance of this work is that it seeks to generalize these results to find those basic properties of performance standards that make hierarchies efficient .

First , experiments will be conducted to explore the types of stresses and phases that affect speech timing , and the precise nature of the effects . A particular concern will be to discover a representation for these effects that will make the specification of the underlying prosodic patterns invariant across changes in speech tempo and segmental content . For example , the representation must allow slow and fast productions of machine recognition to be generated from an invariant specification of the stress and phrasing for this noun phase , and it must allow the use of the same specification in generating the prosodically identical noun phrase sublime delegation . The preliminary experiments will examine the timing patterns of the speech articulators involved in speech production as well as the resulting patterns evident in the acoustic signal . The computational model also will generate both articulatory and acoustic timing patterns ."

Motion analysis will be approached from a computational perspective viewing actions as directed by coordinated processes that specify torques and forces on objects to accomplish purposive behavior . The project will study the problems that arise when objects have many degrees of freedom , when tasks lack precise specification , when unpredictable events and interactions with other objects are commonplace , and when the consequences of actions can not be precisely determined before the action is performed . The project will emphasize fundamental principles for programming complex physical object . Methods for representing objects , specifying tasks , and reasoning about actions will be addressed . Techniques for adaptive , event driven control of concurrent motor functions will be investigated . Particular emphasis will be placed on coordination and methods for maintaining stability and balance . The work will contribute to the ongoing design of a system in which theories of action and control can be easily posed as computational processes and empirically tested in simulation . The physical object simulator Newton will be used to accomplish the work ."

One is a stereo vision technique that uses two cameras at different viewpoints . The major issue in any stereo vision system is the correspondence problem . In this work , a multi-channel feature-based stereo vision technique is proposed in which curve segments are used as the feature primitives in the matching process . A relaxation technique is used to obtain a global match betwen the curve segments in the left and in the right image . Local information about the curve segments as well as the structural information about the objects in the scene are incorporated into the stereo technique . The specific goals are : 1. to develop the proposed stereo technique , and evaluate its performance on a large number of stereo images ; 2. to integrate the stereo technique into an operational robot work cell ; 3. to evaluate its operformance , and compare with existing techniques ."
8809574,ROBOTICS,Matthew Ward,Image Segmentation using Domain Constraint Knowledge,8/1/88,"Current trends in image segmentation indicate that in order to achieve connsistently good results , some form of domain knowledge must be used . Knowledge-based image-segmentation systems traditionally use models of objects and their interrelationships to guide or postprocess the low-level segmentation operation . A major shortcoming of that appproach is the size and complexity of the knowledge base needed for all but trivial domains . The knowledge is often quite difficult to embed in the system and usually is not transferred easily to other domains . Also , processing time can be large . The goal of the proposed work is to explore the use of a small set of domain constraints , namely lighting , camera , and general object surface characteristics , to produce acceptable segmentation results without the need to classify objects beforehand . As images can be constructed graphically using only surface orientation , color , and reflectivity , along with the position and type of lighting , it is hypothesized that general domain information will often be sufficient to perform adequate segmentation . The proposed system will use this knowledge to drive a low-level expert segmentation system , determining parameters , selecting strategies , and resolving ambiguous interpretations ."
8903507,INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE,Michael Kifer,Database Methods in Expert Systems,10/1/89,"In recent years rule-based and frame-based systems became popular tools for developing a wide range of knowledge intensive applications . Although these tools provide significant help to the application developer , building expert systems remains a largely ad hoc and a very labor-intensive activity . Recent achievements in knowledge representation and deductive database research made time ripe for attempting a systematic logic-based approach to expert systems . The proposed contention is that expert system programming can be made more declarative by releaving the developer from the burden of specifying most details of control strategy . This burden should be taken over by the system which will use various optimization techniques to achieve desirable response time . In this research , a language which integrates rules and frames under one roof , and is suitable for reasoning with uncertainty will be designed and implemented . Being purely declarative , this language will allow shortening of the development phase of knowledge-intensive applications and make them more reliable and extensible . Industrial expert system developers as well as knowledge engineering researchers will benefit from theresults of this research ."

These comparative linguistic studies will be based on an operator argument formalism , which in most cases reduces corresponding English and Japanese sentences to structurally identical representations . The results of these studies can then be used to create a translation system , consisting of an analysis phase ( creating operator argument trees ) , a transfer phase ( based on the sublanguage patterns ) , and a generation phase ( to synthesize target language sentences ) .

Significant advances have been made toward understanding how vision systems might solve the individual problems of detecting sudden movements , segmenting the scence into distinct objects on the basic of motion discontinuities , tracking objects of interest , recovering the three-dimensional structure and movement of object surfaces , and inferring their own movement relative to the environment . This research examines how solutions to these problems are integrated into a motion analysis that performs these functions with speed , accuracy , reliability and flexibility . Such a system must embody multiple computational strategies that combine fast and robust methods for deriving qualitative motion information with slower , accurate methods for deriving quantitative models of three- dimensional structure and motion . The approach taken in this project brings together theoretical analyses , implementation and testing of computer algorithms , and observations on human motion perception . This research will lead both to significant improvements in the performance of computer vision systems at analyzing dynamic images , and new understanding of motion analysis in the human visual system ."

The research consists of both theoretical work and experiments on implementations , and includes a number of interrelated projects : ( 1 ) Logic analysis of knowledge update as applied to semantic networks ; we will continue to explore the theory of conditional logic as a framework for dealing with knowledge update in semantic networks , and to compare the resulting accounts of update with those proposed by other computer scientists and logicians . ( 2 ) Articulating the design space for nonmonotonic inheritance reasoners ; building on our foundational investigations , we will begin to work toward a mathematical classification of nonmonotonic inheritance reasoners , and to establish some general theorems in this area . ( 3 ) The theory of nonmonotonic inheritable relations and roles ; we will extend our analyses of inheritance in nonmonotonic semantic networks to richer network representation languages , including at least the resources for describing relations and roles . ( 4 ) The theory of mixed semantic networks ; we will extend our analyses of inheritance to semantic networks in which both strict and defeasible information is mixed together in a single representational structure . ( 5 ) Nonmonotonic hybrid reasoners ; we will explore validated systems that employ both nonmonotonic network-based reasoning and theorem proving in information retrieval . The broader significance of this work is that it addresses the urgent need to design mechanical systems capable of intelligent reasoning in a variety of expert tasks . Such systems will need to store large quantities of complex information in a form that is efficiently accessible by mechanized reasoning processes , and also structured in a way that is intelligible to domain experts so that it can be validated and improved . Research in Artificial Intelligence has shown that there is a conflict between two desirable goals for systems of knowledge representation : they must be powerful enough to express complex concepts , but at the same time they must reason quickly and allow efficient updates . Designing computer systems that can meet both of these goals constitutes a large-scale research project ; new theoretical concepts and experiments with working reasoning systems must both be developed . Our project will combine theory and experiments to produce systems of knowledge representation and knowledge update . The dual approach will produce knowledge and reasoning systems which not only work better , but which are grounded in a sound theoretical analysis ."

The approach is to treat computations as actions , with outcomes of varying probabilities and utilities using decision theory to choose between them . The theory will be incorporated in a multilevel decision theoretic architecture , which extends the idea of explicit metalevel reasoning to cover recursively all aspects of the decision making process . The approach has been applied successfully to game playing systems , and will be modified to apply to single agent problems such as robot motion planning . However , metalevel reasoning to often expensive , and the cost can only be amortized over future problem solving if a compilation mechanism is available . The investigator will therefore study methods for compilation of reasoning processes occuring anywhere in the hierarchy . He will extend explanation based learning techniques to cover the case of choosing best actions , where probabilistic time accuracy tradeoffs play a significant role ."

It is nonetheless possible for humans to infer the structure of objects from incomplete data , presumably through the use of assumptions and computations consistent with natural images . This project focuses on a method in numerical analysis for solving `` inverse problems '' when the degraded scene has undergone a sequence of steps modeled by a known equation . Reconstruction can then be attempted by finding a solution that minimizes the deviation from that equation . The method is exemplified by its application to the deblurring problem . In this problem , deblurring is achieved by computing a succession of images , each slightly deblurred from the previous , such that the complete set satisfies the equations specifying the diffusion process of blurring . Deblurring and more general problems are studied in this project , using the method of minimization of equation error to inject the necessary assumptions to uniquely infer information in visual data ."

On the practical side , means of supporting changes in an Engineering Information System ( EIS ) , that is a repository of information about an engineering artifact such as a VLSI circuit or software system will be investigated . It is now widely recognized that information management is crucial to the success of large scale design efforts . Near term projects in this area include construction of a main memory based data manager for high level synthesis of VLSI circuits ; investigation of performance issues for updates in EIS , particularly as different aspects of the same design are updated in parallel by different engineers , leading to problems of data consistency and task coordination that are critical in large engineering projects . From a more theoretical perspective , there is interest in formal means of reasoning about changes in logical theories . For example , when a new piece of information about the world is discovered , how can one decide what old pieces of knowledge and data to keep , and what to discard in the light of the new information ? This work is relevent to problems in databases ( updating databases with incomplete information ) , philosophy ( belief revision , revision of scientific theories ) , and artificial intelligence ( planning , diagnosis , reasoning about the effects of actions , etc. ) .

Specifically , the researchers set up computerized laboratory markets employing three principal mechanisms : the continuous Double Auction ( as presently used in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ) ; the Specialist Dealer System ( as used in the New York Stock Exchange ) ; and , the Call market ( used to open many financial markets ) . The researchers test for systematic effects of the market mechanism on important market performance measures such as price errors , price volatility , allocational efficiency , the bid-ask spread and trader profits .

8705256,ROBOTICS,Mihran Tuceryan,Perceptual Grouping in Computer Vision ( Computer and Information Science ),7/1/87,"Perceptual grouping is the phenomenon of putting items in the visual field together , or of `` organizing '' image data . It is an `` intermediate '' level process in vision . Such a process of organizing image data requires the use of rules and constraints defined in terms of the image plane entities , such as the Gestalt laws of organization . These constaints are those that are invariant under the projection process . The problems of perceptual grouping in the context of computer vision then are ( i ) To identify important intrinsic properties of the image plane tokens and important image plane relationships among them , and ( ii ) To devise a computational framework in which these properties and their image plane relationships can be identified and larger units can be constructed from these tokens and groups of tokens . The rules to detect the organization need to be completely stated in terms of intrinsic properties of tokens being grouped and their image plane relationships . This research is aimed at studying the grouping phenomenon from a computational viewpoint for patterns containing `` generalized '' tokens . These tokens can be a subset of dots , line segments , curves , and globular or elongated blobs with arbitrary shapes . Our approach primarily involves the use of the Voronoi tessellation ( and its dual Delaunay graph ) as the underlying geometric representation of the spatial distribution of tokens in the scene . A grouping built upon this representation will enforce non-local Gestalt constraints such as alignment of tokens along smooth curves to resolve ambiguous situations . This grouping process integrates the information from different sources each of which detects groupings independently based on token properties such as orientation or size . The algorithms developed in this project will be tested on real images and the usefulness of these grouping algorithms will be assessed in such areas as gap filling in object boundaries , segmenting homogeneous textured regions , and computing optical flow in dynamic images ."

The problem of finding efficient inference mechanisms that can reason in a commonsense manner in the absence of complete information is one of the major research and implementation problems in artificial intelligence .

The reason is that heuristic evaluation functions capture the long-range strategic component of problem solutions , while the discrepancy between heuristic estimates and actual costs is primarily a short-range or tactical phenomenon . Thus , an algorithm with a sufficiently wide search horizon should be able to cope with error in the heuristic function . A two-pronged attach on this problem is proposed .

If behavior is encapsulated , a central query optimizer can not reason about semantics , behavior , and cost over an entire query . The key to performing optimization of queries over encapsulated types is in revealing such information to a trusted system component , and in ensuring that the behavior will not change between the points of revelation and evaluation . Since syntactic analysis of type and behavior definition may yield only limited performance improvement , the type implementor will be able to reveal other relevant information .

This model represents a cluster-based approach to information retrieval . The cluster-based approach is developed around a clustering technique that captures the users concept of closeness between documents .

Typically it is not possible to make the correct choice because the others are logically impossible . Rather the correct choice is simply more plausible , or probable , than the others . This investigator will integrate the use of probability theory into language comprehension in order to better solve these and related problems ( like plan recognition deciding on a story character 's plans on the basis of the character 's actions ) .

The research has two specific objectives . The primary objective is to extend an auditory model developed by Weintraub ( 1986 , 1985 , 1984 ) to incorporate acoustic information sources ( e.g . both periodicity and spectral information ) that can be used to separate targeted speech from unwanted sounds , including other speech . The additional acoustic information should result in a significant improvement of performance when abstracting speech from a background of noise . A Second objective is to develop a new methodology for evaluating a range of signal-processing algorithms , including auditory modeling . This method is based on an information- theoretic approach that follows the ideal-observer concept . With this method , the information actually extracted by a signal- processing algorithm can be compared with the information potentially available in the signal , to obtain a measure of the performance for each algorithm . The project plans to implement several well-known signal processing algorithms for dealing with speech in noise . The result of the of this research allow us to evaluate modifications to the auditory model and compare the performance achieved to that of other signal processing algorithms ."

Modeling of objects to the necessary detail , based on a combination of geometric , algebraic , and probabilistic models . 2 . Development , for each problem , of the joint likelihood of the measured data , and the a priori unknown model parameters , followed by estimation or recognition using new extensions of classical statistical concepts applied to this joint probability function .

We will develop and implement parallel algorithms for recursive logical queries on state-of-the-art multiprocessor systems . We will also examine the use of equational theorem-proving techniques for database manipulation and design . The efficient integration of such techniques with recursive logical queries is an important step in combining functional and logic programming in a structured database context .

The space in which all representations lie is defined , and existing representation schemes are described in terms of this space . In addition , the space is used to suggest new representations . A mathematical analysis of the representations is used to compare different representations in terms of various properties . This analysis has lead to theories about visual processing , and has been used to determine which types of information are best encoded by a particular representation , and is thus useful for choosing an optimal encoding for a given computational task . This research shows that in the early stages of visual processing the choice of representation for a visual feature variable depends not only on the type of information about the variable that is desired , but also on the measurement process used to extract the feature from an image . A tuning-curve technique has been developed for analyzing the measurment process , and thus determining the constraints placed on the choice of representation that are a function of the measurement process . The focus of this project is to study a special representation techniques , call Rho-space representation . It has been developed along with simple parallel connectionist computations for edge analysis . Rho-space has many advantages over other edge representations including : no thresholding of local edge elements is required ; a natural representation of connectivity is created which agrees with human perception ; both coarse and fine representation of orientation information is possible ; and , illusory contours , of the type produced by the human visual system occur ."

The research concerns the design of efficient organizational schemes . In particular , it considers the comparative advantages of hierarchical arrangements . The authors posit a group of agents who are to take actions in a changing environment . The joint action has to meet a performance standard , i.e. , it has to lie in a set that depends on the environment . Each member observes some component of the actual environment and chooses her action after receiving messages from others . A network mechanism prescribes messages sent and actions taken and may be hierarchical . A network mechanism is efficient if it satisfies the performance standard and no other mechanism does so at a smaller informational cost . Cost is measured by the size of the set of messages that agents can send or receive . General techniques for constructing efficient mechanisms have been applied to a multi-plant firm example and an exchange-economy example . The broader significance of this work is that it seeks to generalize these results to find those basic properties of performance standards that make hierarchies efficient . In the same context the researchers study : ( 1 ) dynamic issues , i.e. , the number of steps until actions are obtained ; ( 2 ) reward structures , i.e. , contracts among the group 's agents , so that hierarchies can be examined in light of the incentive problems ; and ( 3 ) promising links to the `` communication complexity '' literature in computer science ."

8920642,INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE,David Maier,Query Optimization in Object-Oriented Database Management Systems with Encapsulated Behavior,9/15/89,"Object-oriented database systems with behavioral encapsulation support powerful data abstractions but are generally slow . Conventional database systems provide efficient query processing , but limited data modeling facilities . This research project seeks new techniques that combine the power of abstract data types with database optimization technology into a semantically powerful and efficient query and command processing system . If behavior is encapsulated , a central query optimizer can not reason about semantics , behavior , and cost over an entire query . The key to performing optimization of queries over encapsulated types is in revealing such information to a trusted system component , and in ensuring that the behavior will not change between the points of revelation and evaluation . Since syntactic analysis of type and behavior definition may yield only limited performance improvement , the type implementor will be able to reveal other relevant information . The project includes the definition of an object-oriented data language , an algebraic query language that permits optimization , a revealing mechanism , an extensible optimizer , and a software prototype to validate the investigated concepts and ideas . The goal of the research is to develop a key technique that will allow object-oriented database systems with encapsulated behavior to attain performance comparable to extensible relational systems , thus making such systems viable alternatives for managing large data volumes ."

The specific topic is how and when to interleave CBR and traditional AI rule.based reasoning ( e.g. , as used in expert systems ) and model.based reasoning , in particular in the situation when the concepts used in the rules or model are not fully defined or admit judgmental decisions . In such problems of interpretation a reasoner seeks to determine the meaning of certain terms and rules as they apply to a given fact situation . This is done by consideration of its applications in past cases . One reasons about the similarities and differences with past cases ( precedents ) in order to determine whether the new case is `` in '' or `` out '' of the category of the rule or predicte in question . This investigation will focus on the architecture and control of a mixed paradigm system that will enable CBR and other reasoning processes to complement each other . The research has three high level goals : ( 1 ) describe mixed paradigm reasoning on interpretation tasks , such as exemplified by problems of interpretation in statutory law ; ( 2 ) use the results of ( 1 ) to suggest and build architectures and control regimes ; ( 3 ) perform experiments to explore and evaluate the approaches of ( 2 ) . Because certain areas of statutory law offer excellent examples for study of such issues , we propose to begin our investigations in an area such as tax law , where we already have experience with CBR techniques .

8618002,"ARTIFICIAL INTELL & COGNIT SCI, CROSS-DIRECTORATE PROGRAMS",Tommaso Toffoli,Information Mechanics ( Computer and Information Science ),7/1/87,"_Information Mechanics_ extends in a natural way the motivations and methods of information theory , which originally dealt primarily with a _static_ bookkeeping of information , to the study of _dynamical_ processes . As a system evolves in time , the parameters that account for the different forms of information encoded in it will evolve too , and one is naturally led to the study of the laws that govern such evolution . An important area of this research is the study of _reversible_ processes . Reversible processes are , by definition , `` information-conserving . '' The generic property of `` reversibility '' expresses itself in a variety of specialized ways as further structure is introduced in the dynamical systems under study . Recent developments and applications show that this is a productive line of investigation , having a direct bearing on the theory and practice of computation and on the mathematical modeling of physics . Motivations and applications for this research are found , among others , in the following problems -- -- Models of computation compatible with microscopic physics ; dissipation in computation . -- -- Invertible cellular automata , and cellular-automaton models of processes traditionally modeled by differential equations . -- -- Lattice gas models of fluid dynamics . -- -- Collective phenomena and phase transitions . -- -- Parallel computation ; synchronization ; special-relativistic effects in distributed computation . -- -- Quantum computation . -- -- Information-theoretical generalization of physical concepts , such as entropy , energy , temperature , and action . -- -- Generalization to computational processes of conservation laws and variational principles . The `` domestication '' of natural physical processes for human goals requires an appropriate understanding of these processes ; thus , the domestication of energy conversion in large amounts ( typified by the development of steam engines during the industrial revolution ) entailed opening up a new chapter of physics , namely thermodynamics . Today we are just beginning to tap the _information_-processing ( rather than _energy_-processing ) resources of physics , say , by turning copper and silicon into computers . However , many modeling tasks of great conceptual or practical interest ( e.g. , in particle physics , meteorology , molecular biology , pattern recognition , optimization problems , etc . ) demand amounts of computation vastly in excess of what can be achieved with the present level of exploitation of nature 's intrinsic computational resources .

The security problem for an MDB is to prevent users from obtaining any unauthorized data . Until recently , research about the security of an MDB was concerned with access control . While access control techniques work to prevent one type of attack , the security can still be subverted by inference attacks . An inference attack to the MDB occurs if a user can infer unauthorized information in the MDB by using his preknowledge about the MDB and query responses authorized to him . This work investigates the inference problems arising from integrity constraints in the database ( i.e. , constraints that enforce the correctness of data ) . Two of the most popular integrity constraints , i.e . functional dependencies ( FDs ) and multivalued dependencies ( MVDs ) , are considered . Examination of the combination effects of FDs and MVDs on the security of an MDB under an elementary item classification scheme will be made . A protection scheme with minimum information loss will be found . The work also will investigate the same problem under a dynamic environment , i.e . data in the MDB can be changed .

In this project , a method is pursued for achieving greater accuracy and depth of conceptual analysis without sacrificing robustness . The basic idea of the method is to analyze the text syntactically producing a chart structure , and then apply pattern matching to the arcs of the chart rather than to the raw text . If successful this method will represent a major innovation in practical processing of natural language . It will lead to more powerful and precise methods for document classification .

A recent algorithm developed by S. and D. Geman uses ideas from statistical mechanics to divide up an image into maximally homogeneous regions with shortest possible boundaries . The approach used in this research is inspired by Geman 's work and involves segmenting by minimizing energy functionals .

Such a model will require an understanding of the abstract prosidic categories of intonation , stress , and phrasing , and a description of how they are implemented in pitch and rhythm patterns . This research is aimed at modeling the timing patterns of English as they reflect abstract prosodic categories . First , experiments will be conducted to explore the types of stresses and phases that affect speech timing , and the precise nature of the effects . A particular concern will be to discover a representation for these effects that will make the specification of the underlying prosodic patterns invariant across changes in speech tempo and segmental content . For example , the representation must allow slow and fast productions of machine recognition to be generated from an invariant specification of the stress and phrasing for this noun phase , and it must allow the use of the same specification in generating the prosodically identical noun phrase sublime delegation . The preliminary experiments will examine the timing patterns of the speech articulators involved in speech production as well as the resulting patterns evident in the acoustic signal . The computational model also will generate both articulatory and acoustic timing patterns ."

Following Barrow 's work on VLSI design , designs are specified in terms on modules , with a formalism for defining action modules whose genesis will lie in the need to create certain interface modules in the design ( e.g . the seating of a bearing on a shaft ) and whose realisation will be as action schemas in the robot control system under development . An action module can be regarded as achieving an assembly goal or goals and goal interactions , which may arise from spatial-resource contention and kinestraints , with an appropriate inference capability being implemented .

The effectiveness of this technique can be attributed to the fact that it provides a simple method for interactively acquiring knowledge from the user that is not available from the query . In systems that use knowledge-based and natural language processing techniques , the ability to interactively acquire domain and linguistic knowledge from users becomes crucial . This is because , in any real application , this knowledge will be incomplete or missing entirely . This research involves experiments explicitly designed to test the hypothesis hat users of an information systems can interactively provide knowledge that will improve retrieval effectiveness . The experiments will address the acquisition of three types of knowledge : ( 1 ) Query knowledge such as the relative importance of words and phrase , ( 2 ) Domain knowledge such as concepts that are related to the query concepts , and ( 3 ) Linguistic knowledge that allows the system to understand compound nouns .

Image processing techniques such as digital filtering and spectral analysis are applied along with incremental scan conversion algorithms to select the pixels which are to be turned on in representing a given character . These techniques can produce both gray scale fonts for color and gray scale CRT 's and binary fonts for printers and typesetters . The study attempts to ascertain which digital filters , and with that parameters , produce the most legible type .

Research on knowledge representation and reasoning therefore has significant potential applications in IS . Description Logics ( DLs ) are a family of knowledge representation schemes that allow one to describe and define concepts describing objects in terms of their membership in classes and their inter-relationships to other objects .

Much of software engineering-design , programming , debugging , testing , code reviews , program demonstrations , and program management-requires collaboration among multiple users , possibly geographically dispersed . In this project the researchers propose to investigate flexible support for the activities of cooperating software engineers . In particular they propose to investigate an approach that offers ( i ) a wide range of concurrency control mechanisms including serializable transactions and interactive transactions ; ( ii ) fine-grain access control for collaborative applications that allows a user to recover from other users ' mistakes and explore various alternatives with them , ( iv ) a multidimensional inheritance model that allows collaboration parameters to be specified independently in hierarchies of groups of objects and groups of users ; and ( v ) multimedia support integrated with concurrency control , access control , and undo/redo . The unique features of this research are its focus on the relationships of these five goals , on flexible mechanisms for achieving each of the goals , and on structured specification of options by end-users . The researchers will use results from previous research done in flexible coupling , long transactions , adaptive concurrency control systems . inheritance , single-user undo/redo , capability-based protection , collaborative tools , and software engineering tools , They plan to implement the approach by extending an existing system developed at Purdue and Minnesota . They will evaluate the performance of the various collaboration methods and study how a particular method can be automatically chosen by the systems based on a minimum performance level requested by the user . In addition to an understanding of the applicability of collaborative technology to software engineering , the research will produce prototype software engineering tools to demonstrate the novel aspects of the research ."

The research is concerned with robust non-rigid image matching , which is required in a variety of domains . In robot vision , non-rigid matching is applied to the tracking of deformable objects . In medical imaging , it is needed in the non-rigid registration of brain structures . In pattern recognition , it is useful in matching handwritten characters and fingerprint minutiae . Also , non-rigid matching distance measures can be applied to clustering image databases . < br/ > This project is to validate and evaluate a new approach to non-rigid image matching in the domain of human brain mapping . The new approach is based on minimizing integrated pose and correspondence objective functions using deterministic annealing methods derived from statistical physics . The basic theme is to derive new distance < br/ > measures and algorithms for non-rigid matching by incorporating parameterized spline-based deformations into these objective functions . The non-rigid integrated pose and correspondence approach has a novel interpretation as weighted graph matching where the graphs are determined by the spline kernels .

The project is concerned with the intelligence exhibited in interactions among sensory-motor activities and cognitive capacities such as reasoning , planning and learning , in both organisms and machines . Such interaction is regularly shown in the act of navigation , which is engaged in by humans and other animals from an early age , and seems almost effortless in normal circumstances thereafter . Whatever there is in navigation that is innate and whatever is learned , it is important to try to understand the interaction of the various cognitive , perceptual , and motor systems that are involved . The complexity of these interactions becomes clear in the development of mobile robots , such as the one recently deployed on Mars , not to mention the more autonomous ones planned for the future . It is still a major and imperfectly understood task to create programs that will coordinate sensors , keep an internal emapn of the area , and allow the robot to cross a space efficiently and without collisions with obstacles . An interdisciplinary approach is being taken in this research project , exploring human capabilities through experiments , developing models based on the experimental results and what is already known about human navigation , implementing these models in programs for robot control , then testing these programs in robotic navigation experiments for their efficacy and their reasonableness as models of human navigation . The goals are both to understand the phenomena in humans and machines and to develop robust algorithms to be used in mobile robots .

The goal of this research is to develop flexible workstation/server database systems which can dynamically adapt to the requirements of a wide range of applications , allowing those applications to exploit database capabilities and benefit from the continuing rapid gains in workstation and local area network price/performance . Such database systems will be able to adaptively choose between query-oriented and navigation-oriented strategies based on both compile-time and runtime considerations . The approach taken will be to extend the techniques that have been recently developed for navigation-oriented OODBMSs to co-exist with techniques from the more traditional query-oriented ( relational ) approach . To achieve this end , however , will require significant work in performance modeling and analysis , the development of new data management algorithms and new query optimization techniques , and the resolution of numerous database systems architecture issues .

Previously funded work in the PI 's laboratory has already demonstrated that simple oscillators can be used to confer upon a robot superlative but narrow dynamical dexterity . The present study attempts to demonstrate that effective coupling techniques for such existing behavioral mechanisms can confer a much broader range of behavior . The empirical project addresses a robotic manipulation scenario termed `` Sensor Driven Dynamical Pick and Place . '' In this scenario , the robot uses a flat paddle to acquire balls thrown into the workspace ; balance or bat them as required through a clutter ; loft them into an out-of-reach destination receptacle ; and resistunanticipated perturbations along the way . The recourse to oscillators reflects an almost exclusive theoretical focus on event driven manipulation . Such a commitment to feedback control addresses the fact that failures in machine reliability frequently occur because of events which are not intrinsically unrecoverable but which violate our models dramatically and can not be anticipated . The focus on error detection and recovery in a dynamical setting brings into correspondence the concerns of the decade old ( and still vigorously developing ) fine motion planning literature and certain concepts and analytical tools from the century old ( and still vigorously developing ) dynamical systems literature that have proven useful in the PI 's previously funded work ."

One very promising solution to this involves enabling the planner to improve performance from experience by reusing previously generated plans to solve new planning problems . Developing effective plan reuse frameworks is thus currently a very active area of research in automated planning , machine learning and case based reasoning communities . Successful design of such planning systems requires a thorough understanding of the fundamental tradeoffs between storage , retrieval and modification in plan reuse . In the previous work , a domain independent planning framework called PRAIR which facilitates flexible modification of existing plans to solve new planning problems in the context of hierarchical least commitment planning has been developed . Experiments with PRAIR have demonstrated its potential to bring about order of magnitude improvements in planning performance by incrementally modifying existing plans in a variety of domains . PRAIR framework thus promises to be an ideal test bed for investigating the issues of utility of reuse . This research , a unified reuse framework is proposed based on PRAIR modification framework , an is used to study the utility tradeoffs involved in plan reuse This framework will also be used to study ways of integrating reuse with other speedup learning techniques such as abstraction and search control rules . The effectiveness of the resulting reuse framework will be demonstrated by experimenting with the classical planning domains and more complex real world applications such as process planning . Results from this research will help to design plan reuse frameworks with demonstrably favorable utility tradeoffs thereby facilitating scaling up of domain independent planning techniques to more complex domains .

Exact navigation algorithms , as well as those that obtain approximate paths with lesser computation time while compromising the optimality are studied . Navigational methods for terrains , where polygonal approximations are inefficient , are explored based on fractal interpolation and approximate path planning . The navigation process involves the problem of extracting information about the geometry of the terrain by suitably combining the sensor outputs . Techniques for ( a ) extracting integrated information , and ( b ) fusing the new information into the existing terrain model , are investigated . Two new paradigms for sensing : ( a ) active sensing where sensor operations are repeated using sequential statistical methods , and ( b ) learning fusion rules from examples where the system is trained with examples using the methods of empirical and structural risk minimization , are proposed . These two methods , together with the existing Bayesian-based methods , provide the design paradigms for the multi-sensor system . For computational purposes , a general distributed sensor system specified by a set of first order propositional sentences is proposed . This system encompasses , as special cases , the distributed versions of Bayesian inference , and geometric reasoning with logic and algebra . In the case of sensors whose outputs are real-valued vectors , the entire process of sensor integration is shown to be implementable in hardware using combinational circuits and comparators . This implementation is particularly suitable for real-time applications . Also implementations on several other computational systems are studied ."

Furthermore , since a multiprocessor is available , the research will also investigate applicability of parallel processing to the optimization process itself . The results of this research will have an impact on efficient query processing in parallel relational databases ."

CCAM assigns the nodes of a graphs to disk pages via the graph partitioning approach to maximize the Connectivity Residue Ratio , i.e. , the chances that a pair of connected nodes are allocated to a common page of the file . Another objective is to develop scalable spatial graph-clustering algorithms as well as incremental reorganization strategies to enhance CCAM . This project also explores strategies to enhance existing geometric access methods for managing connectivity properties along with proximity properties .

Transactions management that provides transparency to concurrency and to failure is vital for Multilevel Secure Database Management Systems ( MLS/DBMSs ) . Concurrent execution of transactions may lead to contention among users for access to data , which in MLS/DBMSs may lead to security problems . Data Conflict-Security ( DC-Security ) identifies a class of covert channels that are caused by contention for access to shared data . This work formalizes the notion of Data Conflict-Security through the use of a formal security model ( Theory of Noninterference ) and formal models of database concurrency control . Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for DC-Security , and a new DC-Secure scheduler for MLS/DBMSs is developed in order to examine related implementation and performance issues . The resulting rigorous theoretical framework for verifying claims of security for transaction schedulers provides a method for determining the security properties of a concurrency control method in a wide area of database applications where both security and fast , reliable transaction processing are of primary concern ."

At the 1996 Summer Workshop on Large Vocabulary Conversational Speech Recognition ( WS96 ) , a model for this variability to be used in Automatic Speech Recognition ( ASR ) systems was developed based on machine- derived descriptions of speech data . The continuation of this work in this grant focuses on studying the correlation of variation in pronunciations in continuous speech and higher-level information not usually brought to bear in an ASR pronunciation model . One important element in this model is the rate of speech , which has been shown to be a good predictor of word error rate on both read and spontaneous speech corpora . Investigations into the effects of resyllabification ( movement of syllable boundaries when words are spoken in sequence ) and word frequency on word pronunciations are also undertaken . The goal of this project is to improve the predictability of variation for speech recognition models , in particular for the reduction of recognition error for spontaneous and conversational speech .

Although version spaces are one of the best known conceptual tools for concept learning , they suffer from three limitations that restrict their use as a practical tool for learning : computational intractability , noise intolerance , and representational inadequacy .

Furthermore , object recognition is not a single isolated task , but rather a complex interaction of a set of closely-related behaviors , including both bottom-up and top down recognition , localization , active recognition , quantitative shape recovery , and object tracking . Not only must these individual problems be solved , they must be integrated within a common representational framework , since a complex recognition task may involve rapid transitions from one behavior to another . Earlier research in the PI 's laboratory began with the introduction of a novel object representation integrating object-centered and viewercentered models , this representation , a probabilistic partbased aspect hierarchy , has formed the foundation for novel approaches to each of the above recognition problems .

With uncorrupted data most of the algorithms perform well , however , once noise is present the results may become unreliable . The noise can appear as uncertainty about the input and/or incorrect assumptions about the underlying model structure . A robust computer vision algorithm should tolerate both types of noise . The methods borrowed from statistics or estimation theory were not designed for visual data where resistance to data uncertainty and tolerance of incorrect assumptions are of paramount importance . Good performance for noisy visual data can only be achieved through robust detection of the consensus among the outputs of a large number of identical non-robust processes , with a methodology called the Consensus Paradigm .

The extraction of information from such large databases has become known as database mining and is an area where machine learning techniques must meet performance requirements of very large database systems . This research focuses on one particular database-mining task , the problem of rule discovery . Rule discovery is viewed as an interactive process with a human in the loop , an iterative process where the user is not only trying to discover interesting results , but also interesting questions to ask . The approach is based on the key idea that rules can themselves be viewed as objects . Under this view the space of possible rules supported by a database can itself be treated as a database , and the rule-discovery process can be approached as a process of querying the rule base implicitly defined by each database . The human in the loop user of the discovery system would interact with the system via ad hoc rulebase queries , designing the desired query interactively as various results are returned during a rule discovery session .

Most methods for inferring depth ( or range ) in computer vision have depended on the use of multiple cameras and normally require the identification of corresponding points in the resulting images . Alternatively , rangefinder methods depend on sharpness-of-focus measures that require calibrated-focus lenses and an unambiguous definition of focus . The planned approach is based on the physics of light transmission and attenuation in a translucent diffuse medium . These investigators have shown , in theory and with a small set of experiments ( in simulated biological tissue ) , that it is straightforward to infer the relative depths of structures when they are embedded in such a medium . This work is particularly exploratory because the original results arose as a byproduct of other research and so the extent of its applicability in a more general setting is not known . Two of the questions to be probed are : what are the limitations ( e.g. , minimum detectable depth difference ) and sensitivities ( to assumptions , and to changes in parameters ) of the model ; and what is the effect of the size and shape of the object on determination of its relative depth . The research is aimed at the development of a capability to identify unambiguously the relative depths of structures in an image , and thus to prevent confusion about which structures overlie which others . Because a single view is sufficient , it will be possible to make this identification retrospectively , as long as the properties of the medium are known . This should be useful in evaluating images arising , for example , in underwater , biological , and atmospheric applications , as well as in more-turbid environments ."

An environment is represented as a graph ( map ) which may be constructed under human control ( e.g . giving the system a tour ) or autonomously as the system explores . As the robot moves during the process of mapping , markers are automatically selected from the video stream and tracked . Rather than using prestored models of landmarks , markers are selected based on image content using a suite of domain-independent operators . The selected markers will be visually distinctive , unique within the image , and stable under varying viewpoint and illumination . During passive map making , the robot is taken on a tour , and it instantiates a graph representing the paths that the robot can follow ; recognition is used to annotate the map .

The central idea is that the variability in the images of an object can be decomposed into component parts - illumination , pose , and shape - each of which , when analyzed separately , is well behaved . This paradigm , termed `` Image Variability Decomposition , '' differs substantially from the appearance-based paradigm in that by decomposing the variability , one is able to uncover generative structures to the set of images over each source of the variability . Thus , unlike appearance-based methods , it is not necessary to have seen the object under all of the seemingly infinite possible permutations of lighting conditions , pose , and shape . Instead , each component of the image variability is explicitly modeled . This research is applied to problems in which this variability plays an important role : face recognition , change detection , structure from motion , and visual tracking . The education component of this award focuses on laboratory and project intensive teaching . Students , both graduate and undergraduate , are not only taught about known unsolved problems , but are encouraged to consider posing new problems in computer vision , robotics , and pattern recognition .

In doing so , it investigates the relevance of two ideas to integration of planning and control . First , it studies the relationship between a plan element ( or action or behavior ) and the concept of a reference model in control theory . This , in conjunction with the arsenal of tools available in control theory for the synthesis and analysis of controllers that guarantee reference model following , may then be used to formally specify the control performance of each action . The second aspect of this research deals with the existence of multiple actions in a plan , connected together through some relationships , and having some ordering . To address this , the use of multiple reference models ( in a control system ) and means to switch between them in a stable fashion is investigated . By studying these problems , an integrated view of certain elements of planning and control may be derived , where reference models are related to actions , switching rules to the initiation and termination of actions , switching sequences to the admissible output of plan executors in deliberative systems , etc .

The research focuses on analytical and experimental study of dynamical dexterity in robotic manipulation , addressing fundamental issues in planning , coordination , and effective use of limited sensory capabilities . The research builds on the PI 's previous research on robot juggling of objects in two dimensions ; this will now be extended to three dimensions . The paradigm of juggling demands a holistic , task-oriented approach to planning and control , involving tracking of one or several objects in space , trajectory matching , making compliant intermittent contact or impact , and coupling of sensing and manipulation in real time . The results should provide a rich addition to the knowledge base for design and execution of a wide variety of robotic tasks including dynamical manipulation of objects on the fly for rapid assembly-line operations , and some forms of dynamic legged locomotion ."

Since such agents must be programmed , the research must provide explicit models of how agents reason to a solution , a task which has never been addressed in traditional game theory . Game theory must be supplemented with representations in which actions , references , and rationality for agents can be defined , as well as with mechanical procedures that allow agents to compute solutions to their decision problems . This project aims to view agents as simple inferential machines that can derive a solution from a set of axioms and inference rules .

The results of this research will form basis for studying how cooperation and coordination can be attained in multi-agent systems ."

9714331,ROBOTICS,Steven Zucker,SGER : Intermediate-level Structural Categories from Visual Complexity Analysis,6/1/97,"This award funds an initial exploration of a theoretical basis for visual image structure , to aid in supporting queries to image archives . Digital image archives are proliferating , which raises the question of how to retrieve specific images from them . However , while queries are naturally posed in high-level , functional terms , the realizations of such queries are based on low-level image operators . An intermediate-level theory of visual structure is necessary to close this gap , which is precisely what this research addresses . Based on an interpretation of edge elements as tangent estimates , it is derived from geometric measure and complexity theory . Viewed from below , the theory provides an organization for edge elements according to dimension . They are either bound into extended ( 1-dimensional ) groups , into ( 2-dimensional ) structural classes that abstract different types of texture , or ( 0-dimensional ) orientation discontinuities . Viewed from above , the representation induces equivalence classes of structure , such as bounding contours , texture flows for hair and grass patterns , and `` T '' -junctions for points of occlusion . Thus queries involving forests can be differentiated from those involving fur patterns or turbulent water , and multiple , overlapping objects can be separated into components . Furthermore , images and drawings can be segmented from pages of text ."

The work is focused in two areas : recognizing curved objects in images , and mobile robot navigation . Recognizing complex curved 3D objects , whose image features depend strongly on viewpoint , is one of the fundamental problems of computer vision . Objects are modelled by collections of algebraic surfaces and their intersection curves , and the geometric constraints involved in predicting and interpreting the images of these models are represented by sets of polynomial constraints . Techniques from algebraic geometry and robust numerical methods can be used to solve these constraints . Viewpoint dependent features are predicted from an object model and represented as an aspect graph which enumerates all topologically distinct views . Elimination theory is used to relate image measurements to objects , and optimization techniques can be applied to estimate an object 's pose ; objects are then recognized from a library of models . Problems to be addressed include automatic generation of object models , new object representations , prediction for sensors with limited resolution , computational efficiency , and indexing large data bases . Mobile robots provide a dynamic test-bed for robust computer vision algorithms in an unstructured world . In addition to developing new sensors , research focuses on obtaining the necessary information to perform a task . While some activities are readily achieved through visual serving , others require developing a 3D representation of the environment . Stereo and structure-from-motion provide 3D information from image measurements which can be incorporated into a relational map . This map forms the basis for motion planning ; paths revisit previously seen places and strategies for exploring new areas can be determined . Additionally , robot tasks and cultural constraints are described more naturally when objects are recognized within this map ."

This research investigates a form of adaptive sonar sensing , in which the sensor changes its physical configuration during the sensing process in reaction to the observed echoes . This approach , analogous to some approaches to active computer vision , is motivated by biological systems that turn their ears toward the direction of the sound source and move to observe an object from different directions . As part of this research , signal processing algorithms are investigated to develop a sensing system that can identify objects by their acoustic signatures . The current model of echo production is extended to predict the echoes observed by the sonar system . The sonar allows the robot to navigate around an unstructured environment precisely and to construct accurate sonar maps by using environmental objects as naturally-occurring beacons . This approach should support more autonomous and flexible operation of both mobile robots and robot arms , thus improving their functionality in manufacturing applications ."

Among them are assumption that there are perfect reasoners and that inferences can be based on arbitrarily deep levels of knowledge . This research on coordination theory is to develop a new notion of practical knowledge upon which to base coordinated decision making . Practical knowledge will take account of several factors which limit a reasoner 's deductive ability such as computational resources available to the reasoner , imperfections in the reasoner 's ability to carry out correct deductions , and faultiness and incompleteness in the data available to the reasoner . Many of these factors have been studied previously in isolation .

The problem of locating and recognizing underlying object structures in an image is of importance in many image analysis and computer vision applications including robot vision , pattern recognition and biomedical image processing .

The robust identification and measurement of such structure is not always achievable using a single analysis technique that depends on a single image derived source of information . This is especially true when one is dealing with a wide range of images obtained under different conditions having different image content . The approach in this research project utilizes two different sources of image-derived information : 1 . ) gray-level gradients and ii . ) homogeneity of intensity or texture elements , etc. , as well as model-based information ( i.e approximate object shape ) . Furthermore , two different processing methods are combined in this approach , in order to integrate the above-mentioned information sources : a ) regionbased methods , which are primarily based on homogeneity properties and b . ) boundary methods which capitalize on both gradient ( imagederived ) and shape ( model based ) properties . A game theoretic framework will be used , where , unlike the global objective approach which is widely used as an integration method in computer vision , the modularity of the underlying objectives are retained . The integration problem is then framed as a family of coupled and coex isting objectives whereby the output of one module depends upon the previous outputs of the other modules . This effort will build on initial work which has been able to locate structure in two dimensional images . It will also extend the concept to analyzing three dimensional image data .

In particular , the focus is on the task-directed recovery of composite models ( models composed os several components ) . The model recovery method is based on the numerical solution os systems of nonlinear constraints using interval bisection . Previous work , based on making decisions about objects modeled by a single parametric form , showed that these methods are general , natural , simple to implement , and computationally effective . In addition , the investigations were able to incorporate notions of the cost of computation and the value of information into the recovery process , and to terminate the recovery process when the model with the highest net value ( decision payoff minus computational cost ) was reached . They are now extending the underlying recovery method by incorporating model refinement and data segmentation in a manner that also exploits information about the sensing task .

So far , constraint satisfaction in disjunctive databases has been relatively unexplored ; nevertheless , it has been shown that there exists a strong connection between disjunctive databases with constraints and the stable model semantics for normal logic programs . Hence , the development of algorithms to check integrity constraints will indicate directions to define procedures to answer queries in normal logic programs under the stable model semantics ."

Most users are not familiar with different query languages and may not be aware of the locations of data . The objective of this project is to facilitate query formulation and to speed up query processing in heterogeneous database environments , i.e . where different types of database systems , specifically , relational , object-oriented , deductive , and textual systems co-exist in an organization or across different organizations . To enable a user who is familiar with only a single query language to access information stored in different types of database systems , translators of query languages are being built . An intelligent data dictionary is constructed to facilitate schema integration and query translation . Query processing performance is optimized by application of logic-based methods , using knowledge about the types of queries previously processed . Parallel processing techniques across different systems are employed to provide further speedup . The resulting heterogeneous query processing system will find wide applicability as the networking of different database systems becomes widespread ."
9002087,ROBOTICS,Ishwar Sethi,Artificial Neural Networks and Decision Trees,2/1/91,"The proposed research is aimed at developing a systematic artificial neural network ( ANN ) design and training methodology and exploring its applications in robotics . The salient feature of the research is the use of statistical pattern recognition techniques to solve some key aspects of ANN and learning procedures . One major limitation of present ANNs operating under the supervised mode of learning is that these networks are unable to self-configure the architecture for a given classification problem . A solution to this problem is to establish a direct relationship between a class of nonparametric classifiers , i.e . decision trees , and the multilayer neural networks . It can be shown that a decision tree can be restructured as a three layered neural net . Exploiting this restructuring allows neural network design and training methodology to have self-configuration capability . The tree-to-network mapping also provides a solution to the credit assignment problem thus making it possible to train each layer separately and progressively . The research will explore automatic tree generation , incorporation of incremental learning , and adaptability in such networks . The proposed methodology will be applied to robot learning where networks are required to perform regression rather than classification . The main expected benefit of the proposed research is that it will make available an ANN design and training procedure that is systematic . This should result in many more applications for artificial neural networks ."

Thus , the agent , rather than the programmer , should learn this from experience . This learning , called reinforcement learning , will be investigated . In particular , two special problems will be studied : that they require the input and output spaces to be completely enumerated ( and have polynomial time complexity ) and that they can not use prior information about the world , information which ought to be able to speed and deepen the learning process . //"

During the strategic-negotiations agents communicate their respective desires and compromise to reach mutually beneficial agreement . Strategic- negotiation is a process that may include several iterations of offers and counter offers . A major consideration in this domain has been to reduce overhead costs resulting from planning and negotiation time .

The issues involve the specification of queries with a preference given to a graphical specification as well as the development of algorithms to process the queries . A query is specified with exemplars of the symbols that are to be found in the database . The symbols in the database are not necessarily classified in advance thereby permitting variation in the quality of the match . Queries to the database involve matching contextual , and spatial constrains . The order in which he different constraints are checked for satisfaction is not fixed , the query optimizer chooses the optimal order . The query images can contain one or more instances of each symbol . The user can specify if all of the symbols must satisfy the spatial constraints or if a maximal subset is also permitted . In the latter case , there is a need for a specification technique for the required subset as well as for the response . The spatial constraints include topological relations such as overlap , encloses , and intersects as well as distance and direction . The symbols are not restricted to point objects thereby also including objects with extent such as lines and areas . The query processing and specification method is integrated with an existing spatial and non-spatial database to enable queries about non-spatial attributes of objects corresponding to the symbols . The results of this research will improve the ability of symbolic image databases and geographic information systems ( GIS ) to efficiently handle large spatial problems , e.g. , adding fiber cables in city planning ."

This is one of eleven winners under that competition . This project is to develop a system that allows rapid prototyping and evaluation of collaboration support structures . It operates in the context of a data browsing and information system based on the Trellis model of hypertext . Trellis uses a formally defined concurrent process model ( nets ) to implement hypertext . This approach provides parallel automation semantics on tip of the features of the commonly used annotated directed graph . A Trellis document has a well defined and analyzable formal structure , and the concurrency aspects of nets give Trellis the capability of managing groups of interactive agents within the structure of a linked document . Trellis documents not only represent relations among information elements , but also serve as the basis for construction of high- level cooperative process descriptions in which the agents of computation are coarse grained and of moderate speed and number . This corresponds to groups of people interacting cooperatively on the solution of a problem involving the browsing and manipulation of information . This project integrates collaboration support methods into hypertext documents and browsing . The unique features and capabilities of the Trellis hypertext model , coupled with the proposed formal extensions and analysis techniques , make this not only technically feasible , but especially appropriate and succinct ."

An investigation is being conducted into the efficient processing of spatial data as arising in problems involving scientific data . Instead of using standard database methods which represent spatial data as points in a higher dimensional space , and then storing the coordinate values in a relation ( equivalent to mapping the data into points in a higher dimensional space ) , the data is organized by sorting it in such a way that the space it occupies is taken into account . Particular attention is focused on the spatial variant of the range query . Algorithms for such queries are being developed in the context of spatial data corresponding to road networks and topography both above ground and underwater ( represented both as contour lines and surfaces ) . Their performance is being evaluated by examining factors such as buffer utilization , page sizes , page faults , data distribution , etc . in environments where the data is spatially sorted and where it is not . The evaluation is in terms of real data obtained by cooperating with the US Bureau of the Census and the US Geological Survey .

Research on planning within AI has led to the development of computational techniques for generating a plan to achieve a specified goal from a specified initial state , given definitions of the available actions . Until recently , however , much of this research has been governed by a number of simplifying assumptions , notably that there is no indeterminacy either in the planning agent 's knowledge , in the effects of its actions , or in the notion of goal satisfaction , and that there are no changes either in the goals presented to the agent or in its environment . This award supports research aimed at relaxing the latter assumption . Specifically , the research investigates the issues involved in extending planning technology to a dynamic setting , in which the agent 's goals and environment are both subject to change . A study is being made of both the theoretical and practical issues presented by situations that call for integrated generation , maintenance , and execution of plans for multiple , changing goals . The project addresses these issues from two complementary points of view . The first is designing and implementing a dynamic planning system that is flexible enough to allow for the experimental investigation of the consequences of adopting different reasoning strategies in different dynamic planning environments . Secondly , but in parallel , a formal analysis is being carried out of the dynamic planning problem , with a special emphasis on providing a clean semantic analysis of the implemented system .

As in other hypertext models , Trellis represents information fragments and the relationships that tie the fragments together . An important premise underlying Trellis is the claim that the actions of browsing a hypertext should be formally represented . A formal description of browsing not only permits analysis and verification of the dynamic properties of a document , but also standardizes the semantics of browsing by providing a succinct , unambiguous , and implementation-independent definition of behavior . Within its notational framework , Trellis provides the ability to synchronize simultaneous traversals of separate paths through the hypertext and the ability to incorporate access considerations into the hypertext , specifyingnodes that can be proven to be visible only to certain classes of browsers . Trellis is a timed model , permitting specification of event delays and durations as well as system-generated invocations . The investigators conduct two main projects under this research . Both are based on the Trellis hypertext work already accomplished .

The goal of this research is to develop schemes for processing data that are strongly related to geographical locations , on a mobile computing platform . Unlike conventional data processing systems , in a wireless mobile computing environment the value of data may depend on location , and processing of a transaction at one site may give different results than that at another . This situation identifies a new type of data , which we refer to as Location Dependent Data ( LDD ) . Thus , LDD is a class of data whose value is determined by ( a ) the geographical location of data storage and ( b ) the geographical location of the Mobile Unit ( MU ) where the query originated . For example , when a query from a MU wants to find out information about local hotels , it will get a different answer in Dallas than in Kansas City . It would even be possible for a traveler driving from Dallas to Kansas City to ask the same question en route but specifically request the response using Kansas City data rather than data based on the location from which he requests the query .

9212074,INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE,Weidong Chen,Reasoning About Database Updates,8/1/92,"Updates are essential in database applications that require reasoning under dynamic situations . The objective of the project is to enhance current database systems with strong capabilities ofmodeling and processing changes . An update calculus and an update algebra have been developed for specifying dynamic queries , and have been shown to be equivalent to each other . This project investigates algorithms for optimization and efficient evaluation of dynamic queries . Hypothetical queries are a special case in which new databases after updates are not needed for answers . Transformations of these queries into static ones are explored in order to take advantage of existing querying technology . This project also pursues simplification and inference techniques for consistency checking so that data integrity can be preserved after updates . Results of the project will extend database technology to a wider class of applications that exhibit complex dynamic behavior ."
9201643,INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE,Margaret Dunham,In Memory Database Recovery Issues,9/15/92,"This is the first of a three year continuing award . The increasing size and decreasing cost of semiconductor memory has prompted research into databases which are memory resident . These Main Memory DataBase ( MMDB ) systems are aimed at high throughput applications such as airline reservation systems , phone switching databases , and other real time systems where the availability of the memory resident data is crucial . To achieve this high availability with volatile RAM requires a backup archive database on disk as well as efficient algorithms to checkpoint the database to the archive and to recover it from the archive to main memory after a system failure . It has been shown that MMDB systems often perform better with deferred update techniques where data to be updated is first placed in a special nonvolatile shadow area and only at transaction commit time is placed in main memory . The authors are investigating both checkpointing and reloading of MMDB databases with the use of more conventional immediate update ( IU ) techniques as well as deferred update ( DU ) strategies . The best checkpointing approaches are to be determined as are partial reloading strategies . A partial reload allows the database to be brought online after a system failure faster because not all of the MMDB is reloaded prior to bringing the system up . This research represents the first examination of techniques for partial reloading of MMDB systems . Due to the volatility of RAM , the high throughput needs of MMDB applications , and the potential for partial reloading to dramatically increase the uptime of database systems , the results and impact of this research are both widespread and significant ."

This research investigates the automatic construction of geometric representations that accurately capture the three-dimensional shape , appearance , and motion of complex scenes in the physical world ( objects , indoor/outdoor environments , and people ) . The central idea is that a reconstructed 3D'shape must be consistent with a scene 's photographs in order to be a valid geometric description of that scene . In this paradigm , termed `` Appearance-Driven Reconstruction , '' shape recovery is formulated as a geometric constraint satisfaction problem , where every input photograph is a constraint that restricts the space of all possible 3D shapes to only those shapes that reproduce that photograph . When many such photographs are available , each taken from a known position in space , they define an equivalence class of 3D shape solutions called photo-consistent shapes that simultaneously reproduce all input photographs when viewed from the photographs ' viewpoints . The resulting algorithms aim to ( 1 ) compute these shapes for a hierarchy of increasingly more complex models for scene reflectance , illumination , and the image formation process , ( 2 ) provably handle scenes of arbitrary geometry and topology , ( 3 ) accept arbitrary collections of raw , unprocessed photographs as input . Educational activities will center around a new laboratory facility for Appearance-Driven Reconstruction where undergraduate and graduate students will be immersed into research as soon as possible . Course development will include ( 1 ) a new project-intensive undergraduate'course on `` Visual Computing '' and ( 2 ) a restructuring of the graduate computer vision course to emphasize applications in computer graphics and image-based rendering. < br/ >"
9820721,INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE,A. Murat Tekalp,An Intelligent Visual Database System : Hierarchical Content Description and Matching Using Integrated Similarity Metrics,9/15/99,"The goal of this research is to develop an intelligent visual database system that enables learning from user search patterns to automatically extract and annotate semantic objects in a large collection of images ( i.e. , learning by example ) . To this effect , the approach used in this project is based on a content-based hierarchical representation of images , where low-level homogeneous color regions ( elementary regions ) form the lowest level in the hierarchy . Higher-level ( composite ) nodes are formed by selected combinations of these regions that match in color and/or shape one or more example templates provided by the user . Composite nodes correspond to semantic objects that are generated automatically according to our learning by example procedure . A hierarchical content matching procedure is also developed , where the hierarchical image representation is searched in a top-down fashion . This procedure enables very efficient retrieval of images containing the `` learned '' objects in subsequent searches . The results of this research will yield procedures for automatic segmentation of semantic objects according to user provided example templates for automatic indexing of large visual databases , and very fast retrieval of images containing such objects in visual databases that employ the developed hierarchical content representation . < br/ > http : //www.ece.rochester.edu/~tekalp < br/ >"

While word of mouth always disseminates reputations informally , computer networks can now vastly accelerate and add structure to the process , gathering information about past behavior swiftly and systematically , and distributing it to a broad audience . The proposed research seeks to : characterize the alternative designs for reputation systems ; use game theory to understand alternative models of reputation systems ; and examine empirically the performance of systems at work .

9978510,INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE,Nandit Soparkar,Mining Databases Across Multiple Tables,10/1/99,"Current mining technology typically applies to centrally stored data ( i.e. , in one single repository , with central administration , etc. ) . However , real-life datasets are often decentralized ( i.e. , consisting of several tables , perhaps obtained via normalization or partitioning / allocation , stored in several repositories ) . The goal of this research project is to develop mining techniques for decentralized data . The key idea is that in contrast to traditional techniques ( where the data is joined first to form a single table ) , the decentralized approach concurrently generates partial results on the separate tables , and thereafter , the foreign key relationships are utilized to merge these results . A similar approach is examined for classification in decentralized datasets , and the techniques chosen are those most amenable to decentralization , or as indicated by the applications . Efficiency analyses is used to assess the techniques , and empirically validated on available synthetic and real datasets . The effect of different database design choices on the decentralized mining algorithms is also considered . Systematic techniques are developed to use , together with the catalog statistics , the details of database design ( e.g. , normalization , and partitioning/allocation information ) to optimize for efficient execution . Furthermore , the techniques can be applied to mining distributed relational metadata for public information repositories ; e.g. , it can help simple web searching as well as allow programming advanced applications , such as information mining , for the datasets referenced - initially for those by students , and thereafter , users of any Web-based datasets .

9986030,INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE,H Jagadish,SGER : Managing Hierarchically Organized Data in Modern Databases,10/1/99,"Hierarchical databases were standard thirty years ago , but have been completely supplanted by relational databases since , in spite of hierarchy remaining the most common way in which we organize information in other spheres . The goal of this research project is to re-evaluate hierarchical databases in the light of the progress made in database technology . The thesis is that relational databases supplanted hierarchical databases not because flat relations provided a superior organization of the data , but rather on account of other crucial benefits relational technology provided , namely the separation of data organization from application logic and the notion of a declarative query language . The approach in this project is to begin with LDAP ( Lightweight Directory Access Protocol ) as a rudimentary hierarchical database , and to extend it to provide full-fledged database functionality . The results of this project will demonstrate the feasibility and value of building a hierarchical database as a far more flexible and scalable structure than the relational databases that are prevalent today . < br/ > http : //www.eecs.umich.edu/~jag/ < br/ > < br/ >"
